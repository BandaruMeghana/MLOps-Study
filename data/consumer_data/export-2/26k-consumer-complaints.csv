I was told that "" I have to sign the change forms '', which I did. Afterward, I asked to get a copy of all the documents that I signed, and I was told that I could not have the copies. It was explained by more than XXXX employee, including the manger of the branch, that the policy forbids that they release those "" internal '' forms to me. I explained that as soon as my signature was required, and I signed the form, that whether they considered them "" internal '' or not, I was entitled to copies of my own documents that contained my signature. 3+hours later, I was told that the district manager would contact me, which she did.

The answer in # XXXX is an example of the doublespeak and equivocation that I am describing : "" no disclosures '' in my understanding means no approved public material that the bank will release to explain their policy. That does NOT answer the question as to whether the bank is taking the position that they flatly refuse to make copies of a client 's signature and give it to him as part of ANY FORM that he signed.  5.

The letter stated I would be required to show a satisfactory payment history of at least XXXX months and provide a new appraisal or BPO prepared by Ocwen 's designated vendor before termination of PMI would be considered. I called Ocwen again ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and was told by a representative that Ocwen 's internal policy required that I follow the procedures outlined in the XX/XX/XXXX letter - no other options were available. I asked to speak to the supervisor. I was told the supervisor was unavailable. I asked how to get alternative consideration since the loan balance was now so small. She said she would submit a dispute/request on my behalf asking for retroactive termination of PMI to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but her system did not permit her to provide me with any copy. I then received a letter ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) stating that PMI would be terminated only when the loan amortization schedule ( XXXX years ) reached an LTV of 78 %. The date could not be altered by payment of additional principal. I called Ocwen again ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and spoke with a representative about both letters, pointing out that both ignored the fact the original loan balance had been reduced by over 92 % with the XXXX loan payment. The representative told me for the first time I could have PMI terminated by providing an appraisal that was issued no earlier than XXXX days prior to requesting PMI termination. I told her I had requested termination of PMI in XX/XX/XXXX, when the original loan appraisal was only XXXX days old, but that in neither prior phone call or in the XXXX Ocwen letters was there any mention about the option to deliver the original appraisal, which with the reduced LTV percentage ( now less than 7.5 % ) would have satisfied the PMI termination requirements. The rep told me to send a letter requesting special consideration and enclose a copy of the appraisal. I did that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The response from Ocwen was yet another form letter, reciting the same requirements I had been told on the phone. I paid off the loan in full on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. When I requested a payoff quote, the letter from Ocwen told me I could contact Ocwen 's Consumer Ombusdsman, an office created as a resource to assist with unresolved concerns and issues. In no prior phone conversation with any Ocwen, rep nor in any prior letter from Ocwen had I been informed that such an office existed. I called that office and explained the entire story and history of the PMI issue. I was promised a quick response. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received an email from the Ocwen Ombudsman reciting that I had not submitted a current appraisal dated within XXXX months of the PMI suspension request, so PMI would not be refunded. Yet again, the loan payment circumstances were simply ignored. I have never received any refund of the PMI payments.  ",Ocwen,UT,84100.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

64055,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"This is my fifth complaint against Key Bank because of excessive overdraft fees. I am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest Key Bank 's posting practices are. Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n't low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that 's Key Bank Magical Accounting for you! I 'm posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on Key Bank to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people 's balances. I do n't even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n't know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with Key Bank 's accounting. Key Bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that Key Bank is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son 's account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items, though I was only charged for XXXX. this is very unclear unprofessional accounting. If I did not have direct deposits coming into this account, I would close it. And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business. They do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that I have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance. Get it together Key Bank. Adding and Subtracting are basic math skills that you should have. Stop reordering items to benefit yourselves. Give people a break.

After speaking with several reps re : this matter, I was informed that XXXX had been applying miscellaneous fees and charges to my account offsetting my monthly payment and only applying partial payments to my account as if I was not making my monthly payments in full every month. I was also informed there had been missing payments in the past on my account resulting in more derogatory information being supplied to the credit bureaus. Infuriated by this new information, I explained to the reps that I had never been late nor had I missed any payments, and all my payments had been paid in full based on what was due in my monthly statement. I also explained that I had a trail of receipts in the form of emails, screenshots from my smart phone, and my bank statements showing these payments were made in full on time. I then inquired as to why this had never been brought to my attention in the numerous conversations I have had with XXXX reps in the past and no rep could explain to me what the problem was. This was XXXX of the many issues I have had with XXXX reps. Every time I have spoken with a rep it has been nothing but inconsistent, incorrect information. After speaking to the last XXXX reps XXXX ( XXXX ) in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ( XXXX ) in XXXX, XXXX and inquiring about the discrepancies with my account, I asked if there was a higher division or department where I could speak to someone directly since no one at the basic phone reps level could assist me further, I was told no, there was no one to speak to directly regarding my dispute on my account and issues regarding this matter and it would have to be escalated to customer care via mail only. I inquired once more to see if I could get a phone number or even a fax number and again there was nothing to be provided and I just have to mail in my concerns. I was beyond angry with this information. How could a company this big not have any direct contact information for matters of this nature. Credit is extremely important in this day and age and to not have any one or any department to directly assist with credit disputes is completely unacceptable. To date XXXX has placed XXXX late payments on my credit reports which has severely damaged my credit. At this time I am requesting XXXX to thoroughly go over my account, find where the mistakes were made, correct the mistakes, and update my credit reports with correct information.

I did not enter into any kind of agreement or sign any documents with XXXX as an Independent Contractor, the findings from government agencies state that this strictly an employee status NOT an Independent Contractor.

64170,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I bought my house in XXXX XXXX. From that time, until XXXX XXXX, I never missed a payment and never paid late. I was paid once a month, on the last day of each month, and would use that check to make my payment due on the first. For example, my XXXX check would be used to make my XXXX XXXX payment, my XXXX XXXX check was used for my XXXX XXXX payment, and so on.   In XXXX XXXX, this changed because my bank account was illegally accessed, completely cleaning it out. Fortunately, I 'd already made my XXXX XXXX mortgage payment before this happened, so I was fine for that month. However, because I now had to wait until my next check to pay my other bills, I was set back with my mortgage payment. This meant that my paycheck at the end of the month would go toward the month that already past. I had to use my XXXX XXXX check to pay my bills for the month that passed, not for my XXXX XXXX mortgage payment, so I had to wait for my XXXX XXXX check to make the mortgage payment that was due on XXXX XXXX.   For the next year, I was in a cycle of making my mortgage payment at the end of the month. Each month, I had to pay a late fee, but I was determined to at least avoid having a 30 day late pay on record for my mortgage.   Meanwhile, I tried to make arrangements with creditors to get back on track. Most, were able to work with me. For example, my car loan company moved one payment to the end of my loan, allowing me to skip one payment so I could get back to paying for the upcoming month, instead of the month that had passed.   In XXXX XXXX, I contacted PHH to see if I might be able to make the same arrangement with my mortgage payment. The told me I could n't do that, but they could do a loan modification. To do so, they told me they 'd give me a lower payment that I 'd need to make over a 4-month trial period. Once I 'd shown I could make that payment, my payment would be reduced to that amount permanently.   I did this for 4 months, but there was still no resolution as far as getting me back on the pay schedule I was on before. I contacted a conventional loan company just to get information. When they looked into my credit, they informed me that according to PHH, I was now 4 months late on paying my mortgage. I contacted PHH and they told me that was true and that even though I 'd followed what they told me, I was now considered to be 4 months behind. They also told me that my new "" modified '' loan payment would be less each month, but my interest rate would increase.   In XXXX XXXX, since I was now considered to be behind on my loan, I asked what my options were. They told me they 'd put me on a Repayment Plan where I 'd need to make essentially a double mortgage payment due XX/XX/XXXX, then make five monthly mortgage payments that were XXXX % higher than my actual mortgage payment. Once I 'd made all 5, I 'd be caught up on my payments.   I made the double payment and for the past 5 months, I 've made my 20 % higher mortgage payments on time. The last payment was due XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I recently talked with PHH and was told that once that payment is made, I 'll be caught up and can go back to what my modified payment is. This payment is due on XXXX XXXX. So I 'll have a XXXX % higher payment due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and a regular payment due the next day, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. If I 'm not able to make the XXXX XXXX payment, the late cycle will continue. I 've already made my last payment of the repayment plan and am currently trying to make arrangements to make my XXXX XXXX payment.   According to my credit report, PHH shows me as being 10 months late on my mortgage. My credit is completely ruined as a result. I would like to get a conventional loan to no longer deal with PHH, or at least no longer pay my PMI ( I qualify based on my LTV but FHA law says I have to have the loan for 5 years ), but no one will qualify me since PHH shows me having 10 late pays.

It said there was a {$350.00} balance on an account that was opened in XXXX 2014 and reported as a collection in XXXX 2014.   Because I did not owe XXXX any money since I did n't have service through them I disputed the account with the XXXX credit bureaus.

I notified them trough my representative that I in fact did hire XXXX to provide me with XXXX XXXX. The very same day that I received the equipment and it was installed, I was told by their service technician that it was not going to work because XXXX was not able to provide a signal and therefore there was no service in my area.

They have failed to provide any documentation and neither me or my representative have received any communication on this whatsoever.

I told her I could not afford this, I am the only one working and have XXXX kids and a house payment.

Having previously only worked with banks and finance companies such as XXXX XXXX I found the experience with Wells Fargo Dealer Services to be as surprising as it was unpleasant and predatory. For XXXX good starting example, the loan was originally written by WFS Financial which later became WFS Dealer Services which later became Wells Fargo Dealer Services and though the name changed the bad experience remained the same.   Soon after purchasing my XXXX XXXX XXXX my professional and financial situation took a turn for the worse and within the XXXX XXXX payments I fell behind by XXXX month and very nearly lost the car to repossession. For the next XXXX ( nearly XXXX ) years and with much difficulty I managed to make the payments and ultimately pay off the loan in full ahead of term in XXXX XXXX. The loan was for XXXX years, the amount financed was approximately {$15000.00}, the total amount paid by me was approximately {$30000.00} and the interest rate was approximately XXXX percent annually.   Over the course of the loan during my difficulties the named finance company increased my rates and payments and charged me for unneeded services such as auto insurance stating inaccurately that I did n't have any insurance on the car. They also stated that there were no provisions available to their customers who were having financial difficulty until the customer was able to show that their situation had improved.

The house is FULLY paid off and appraised at $ XXXX after repairs which were estimated at $ XXXX by the appraiser, yet Wells Fargo will not give me any type of loan. That is plenty of collateral. On my appraisal report, the appraiser mentioned that there is a possible foundation problem and a foundation inspection is recommended. They also told me this in person during the inspection. I had a certified contractor inspect the damage and he gave a preliminary report that no foundation damage was found. I submitted his report to my mortgage banker, and was then told that the report did n't matter because I was being denied solely on having a leaking roof and holes in my ceiling. After questioning why I was denied for that reason ( because they knew initially about the damage ), I was given the run around. I was passed around to different departments and given different reasons as to why I was denied in the end. After speaking with a manager, she informed me that a new department was just newly opened that would suit my needs perfectly ; A Home Renovation Mortgage. She said that all of my information would be forwarded to a loan consultant in that department, and I would still be able to keep my same interest rate that I was pre-approved for. After the renovation mortgage consultant looked over all of my files, he called and informed me that I was denied due to my credit score. He stated what the minimum credit score must be to obtain a renovation loan. I quoted him my credit score and told him it was higher than the minimum he just quoted me. He said he would need to talk to his manager and call me back. When he called me back, he said he was mistaken at the minimum required credit score was actually higher than what he had quoted me less than an hour prior. I then asked him about adding a co-signer on the loan application. He told me that I still would n't get approved. When I asked him why not, he could n't give me an answer.

64340,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I cosigned on a car loan for my son at Wells Fargo Dealer Services in XXXX of XXXX. Six months later, in XXXX of XXXX, the car was involved in an accident that totaled the car. The other driver was at fault and their insurance company took 6 months to settle the claim on the car. In the meantime my son continued to make his regular payments to Wells Fargo on the loan. We did, however, cancel the insurance on the vehicle as it was sitting in a junk yard from the date of the accident. We had an ongoing problem with Wells Fargo putting insurance on the car and sending the charges to us. We had to keep contacting Wells Fargo and requesting that they remove the insurance as the car was not drivable. Finally one of their agents explained to us that if we produced the insurance report that showed that the car had been declared a total wreck they would stop trying to charge us for unnecessary insurance. I have included this correspondence.  The other driver 's insurance company finally came through with a check to pay-off the loan on the car in late XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX was extremely slow in coming up with the money to settle our claim but that was also compounded by Wells Fargo 's inability to give them an accurate pay-off. I have included two print-outs received from Wells Fargo. The first from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that says the pay-off amount through XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is {$8300.00}. The second one on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX says the pay-off good through XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is only {$8100.00}. Obviously Wells Fargo was having trouble determining the exact amount of the loan themselves. The check was sent directly to Wells Fargo.  We thought the matter was settled but in XXXX of XXXX I got a bill from Wells Fargo Dealer Services for {$500.00}. I thought that this might still be insurance charges that had n't been properly removed from the loan amount. I called Wells Fargo to inquire about this additional amount owed within a few days of receiving the notice. The customer service reps I talked to had a very difficult time determining just how much the insurance check had been applied to the loan. I have included a printout of the screen I pulled up for the account. It seems to show that only {$7500.00} of the insurance check had been applied to the loan. The service rep said I would get a return call explaining what happened. Needless to say, I never got a call. Our lawyer attempted to call and get an explanation. When the service rep could n't explain the way the charges were applied, she simply hung up on him. I tried several other times to get someone at Wells Fargo to explain it to me. They would either hang up on me or tell me they had to put me on hold to ask someone a question and then put my call back into the queue so I would have to explain the problem all over again to a new person. I finally reached someone XXXX/XXXX/XXXX who said he would give me a credit the remaining amount on the loan ( which, by the way, kept changing each time I called ). When I asked him what the remaining balance was for his reply was "" just be happy I 'm was taking care of the problem '' and hung up.  In XXXX of XXXX Wells Fargo Dealer Services put a bad mark on my credit report for a late payment. When I discovered this in XXXX of XXXX, I immediately sent them a letter explaining the situation and requesting they remove the mark.

After the phone calls stopped, I was led to believe that my balance with them was paid off from the sale of the car. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email requesting I call ASF with no information about my account included. After calling, I was told I still owed a balance of around {$5900.00} after the vehicle 's value had been applied to my account. I spoke briefly to a representative ( XXXX XXXX ) about making realistic payment arrangements, at which point I was told to "" pay what you can. '' In XX/XX/XXXX, ASF called my wife who was never on the car, nor was she my spouse at the time of financing, stating they got her number using skiptrace. It was at this point they told me that I owed a balance of over {$13000.00}. I requested to speak to XXXX XXXX, the Senior Account Manager, whom I had dealt with in the past. The woman who I spoke to told me she would inform XXXX, but he never reached out to me. The company did not communicate any balance information to me from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. After ASF called my wife, they said they could not reach me because I had not updated them on my new address, which I did not move into until XX/XX/XXXX.   Late XX/XX/XXXX, I received a package, sent standard mail from ASF, stating that I was being served a warrant-in-debt for the balance I owed to them. What is notable about the paperwork is that it is all dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( the case was not filed with the XXXX XXXX court until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), lacks a case number, was not presented in any official capacity and is missing signatures of court-appointed officials everywhere they are required. The warrant was not served by a person or certified mail. The attached affidavits were not signed by any court official and were improperly completed, including incomplete notarization. ASF even went so far as to fill in a section marked COURT ORDER ONLY with what appears to be a sticker of a lawyer 's name and address. This section was not signed by a judge as the affidavit states it should, leading me to believe that this lawyer was not appointed by the courts but rather ASF. I did not reach out to him. Another notable piece of paperwork is the Affidavit of Claim which was notarized by the same person who was the Affiant on the other documents, XXXX XXXX.   According to ASF 's payment history the account balance began at {$35000.00} - the total of all payments, including interest. The amount that was supposed to be financed, according to the buyer 's order was {$25000.00}. I was led to believe that interest accrued daily and would not be added to the principal of the loan as it was. After being misled and bullied by ASF from the beginning and having my credit significantly damaged by being forced into taking repossession action, ASF is now trying to force me into repayment by officially taking legal action after sending me paperwork supporting the idea they already did.

64409,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"Chase VISA card unjustly denied my claim for damage to a car I rented in XXXX. The following is a copy of my appeal which sets out the facts : I wish to appeal your denial of my claim for damage incurred on XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX passenger car I rented in XXXX on the grounds that the denial was arbitrary with no basis in your program rules or procedures.   1. I have now reviewed your Guide to Travel and PurchaseProtection Benefits, a booklet I, like most travelers, do not carry with me overseas. And, like most travelers, I remember that when renting a car overseas you provide collision damage coverage as long as the insurance offered by the rental agency is declined. What I have learned is that even carrying the booklet is not much help because when making a telephone inquiry you receive unreliable information.  In your program rules you ask cardholders to call to find out whether a particular vehicle is covered by your damage insurance yet a positive response can be overridden when a claim is filed as I have learned.  In my case I rented a XXXX on short notice on XX/XX/XXXX while traveling in XXXX. The vehicle was damaged in a XXXX car accident later that day. I called your representative ( XXXX ) as soon as I returned to the XXXX to find out how to file a claim for the damage. She asked where the accident occurred and the make and model of the vehicle. When I told her XXXX and the vehicle was a XXXX XXXX, she said that XXXX model might not be covered but would check. That came as a shock since I was unaware certain XXXX vehicles were not covered. However, after a short hold, she came back on the line and told me this model of XXXX in fact WAS covered and would send me a claim form via email. ( If I had made this call from XXXX before renting this car, I would have relied on the information and rightly believed it was covered from the outset. ) Based on being told the vehicle was covered, I filed a claim for the damage with all the supporting documents required. A few days later I received an email from you saying an important document was attached. However, nothing was attached so I called and talked with your representative XXXX XXXX. She checked your claim file and told me that you denied the claim on the grounds that the model XXXX I rented was NOT covered.  I then explained to her I was told in an earlier phone call that the vehicle WAS covered. She said they would check the telephone records.  I also asked her for a copy of your list of XXXX models that are covered but she refused to provide it. This refusal raises an obvious question of whether in fact there is such a list.  Later XXXX XXXX called back. The telephone recordings must have confirmed what I was told because this time she said the claim was denied because of the nature of the car rental agency.   2. Nowhere in the terms of your Guide to Travel and Purchase Protection Benefits booklet is there any mention whatsoever of the nature of the auto rental agency required in order to qualify for coverage of a passenger vehicle.   In the phone call referred to above, XXXX XXXX said the claim was denied because the auto rental agency rents performance cars. It 's true that the agency rents performance cars among others but the XXXX XXXX is not in that category. I rented that model in XXXX because it was available and is on the list of the XXXX best cars in XX/XX/XXXX as rated by XXXX.   In sum it appears that when you are found to have stated that coverage on a particular XXXX model IS available, you then resort to a reason with no basis in your program rules to deny a claim.

Unfortunately my doubts were actually reality!

Wells Fargo Home Mortgage has been servicing my mortgage loan for over 10 years and has denied me the opportunity to modify my high interest loan. I currently have an FHA loan with an interest rate of 7.25 %. I have made at least XXXX attempts to apply and qualify for a loan modification to reduce my interest rate and monthly mortgage payment through various mortgage assistance options that were readily available to consumers like myself over the years. I have applied for the streamline refinance, recast, and President Obama 's Making Home Affordable Plan and other loan modification plans for the past XXXX years and Wells Fargo has continually denied my request based upon their investor guidelines from what I have been told. When I initially reached out to the CFPB I was hoping to receive additional guidance and support on how to communicate with Wells Fargo and bypass the blatant discrimination practices I have had to endure throughout this process. In XX/XX/XXXX, I suffered an economic hardship after I became unemployed as a result of a massive company layoff after working nearly XXXX years on the job. I filed for unemployment and received {$140.00} per week until I became gainfully employed in XX/XX/XXXX. When I notified Wells Fargo to explain my hardship and the drastic reduction of income due to the layoff, I was hoping to receive an offer to reduce the monthly mortgage payment until my financial situation had improved. However Wells Fargo claims the only option the investor could offer me to prevent foreclosure on my home was to accept a repayment plan that would increase the current monthly mortgage payment of {$1000.00} to {$1600.00} per month if I want to keep my home and avoid foreclosure. I was informed by Wells Fargo once again, that I am ineligible for any mortgage assistance options, including a loan modification, recast or streamline refinance based upon the investor guidelines for my specific loan. Following the denial, I consulted with a HUD counselor, real estate attorney and other knowledgeable lenders in the real estate industry and I learned there may be a better solution or alternative to help me keep my home. At this time, I am requesting that the CFPB investigate and review all prior and current complaints against Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to let me know whether or not Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and the Investor for my loan who has continually denied my request to modify my loan for the past 15 years has engaged in housing discrimination. Based upon my limited understanding of the Fair Housing Laws and rules and regulations of the CFPB and the Dodd-Frank Act I strongly agree that Wells Fargo is not in compliance with the rules and regulations of the CFPB and Federal Laws. Furthermore, I have now become a victim of discrimination due to my age, race, gender and familial status. The interest rate I have at 7.25 % is not an affordable rate and I want my interest rate reduced to reflect the current market rate in order to provide me with an affordable monthly mortgage payment so I may continue to reside in my home.

Fay said that through there modification process they would work with me and get my payment lowered to an amount that I could afford. Loan modifications are done to help keep home owners in their homes. This is suppose to be the reason that this company even exist so I thought. Upon reading up on Fay Servicing it turns out that Fay Servicing has opened a new division XX/XX/XXXX. An REO Division. Which is unfortunate for me because instead of trying to help me they their goals were always the opposite. They just wanted my property. My loan was already in default when they purchased it so since the home has a market value of XXXX dollars and only XXXX owed my property fell right in line with Fay 's REO Division. Fay with investors from XXXX XXXX Purchased my property and many others like it from XXXX XXXX with the intent of taking the property and foreclosing on the homeowners.

I responded to Citibank with information regarding the statements and the fact that the card does not appear on my credit report. I have a copy of that letter.   I heard nothing from either XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX or Citibank until a XXXX was issued in an amount just over {$17000.00} for the XX/XX/XXXX tax year.   This erroneous XXXX will have serious ramifications for me and not just any potential tax liability. The IRS can unwind any erroneous tax calculation at any time. However, this error impacts my XXXX subsidy and my son 's college financial aid. Our FAFSA will need to be linked to our XX/XX/XXXX XXXX before the fall term. I will be able to demonstrate actual damages that may NOT be able to be rectified, i.e. my son 's Financial Aid which has strict deadlines, if this matter is not looked into and investigated. It needs to be resolved promptly.   Interestingly, I was sued by Citibank back in XX/XX/XXXX for a little over {$16000.00}. Citibank continues to collect on that judgment, issuing garnishments, etc. The lawsuit filed by Citibank states that this is for an account ending in XXXX, however, subsequent exhibits attached to a Motion for Summary Disposition ( of which I do not have copies but the court and Citi 's law firm, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX should have copies ) included statements for an account ending not only in XXXX but also XXXX. Both those accounts are reflected on my credit reports. I believe that the XXXX account number changed when XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was acquired by Citibank, hence XXXX numbers for the XXXX account. That suit was filed in the XXXX District Court in XXXX XXXX, Michigan, case number XXXX. ( The XXXX is for XXXX XXXX since the court also meets in XXXX and XXXX ).   In summary, I have no records of any credit card with this number. Not in my accounting software nor in my handwritten hard copy back up. It has never appeared on my credit report, at least since I have regularly pulled those reports starting in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX all my accounts were reported as current. There is no record of this credit card from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. When asked for any proof, all that was provided were some recent statements that showed no activity, just a past due balance accruing interest. I was sued by CitiBank back in XX/XX/XXXX for an almost identical amount. Citibank has a judgment on that amount and their attorneys continue collection procedures.

We were able to pay our mortgage payment on time for several months from our savings and money borrowed from family members. Our savings were eventually depleted after several months before we found new employment.   Our problems with Wells Fargo began when we had secured new jobs. The dates of our paycheck cycle changed to the XXXX of each month. We have faithfully paid our mortgage on the XXXX of each month but have accumulated monthly late charges since the end of XXXX because late fees are assessed for payments received after the XXXX of each month. After several months of unemployment and difficulty paying our other bills, we did not have the cash on hand to pay an extra month 's payment to catch up on the billing cycle of our mortgage company. We had even made a partial payment of {$3100.00} when we first got new jobs to help cover the time span from the XXXX of the month to the XXXX, but this was put into an escrow account by our mortgage servicer and was never credited to our payment history.

The many customer service representatives we have spoken to over the past 6 years have given us conflicting directions. Some reps told us that this was impossible with a loan modification, others told us that the entire loan would have to be redrawn, and still others have told us that only speaking to a manager for the Customer Service division could change the payment date.

'' I asked to speak with the supervisor 's supervisor and was told I would receive a call back. I did not receive that call. This process took more than an hour.

No credit card or line of credit is associated with this account. 4 ) The charge I disputed is the only charge on that account for XX/XX/XXXX ( there were also no charges in XX/XX/XXXX ). I have since moved most money from that account out of concern that fraudulent activity might resume. XXXX ) I do n't know the source of the charge. Wells Fargo has not told me if they consider the charge to be a debit-card charge, a credit-card charge, or some other type of transfer ( the first XXXX should not be possible ). I presume it 's not a check since no image is posted online. 6 ) Lacking information from Wells Fargo, I do n't know how to contact the source of the charge -- I ca n't find them online from the information provided -- and I do n't know whether this is simply a mistake or fraudulent activity. 7 ) Wells Fargo indicated that they made no attempt to ascertain whether or not the charge was fraudulent or an error. Their investigation was limited to whether or not I had noticed the charge in time. 8 ) The idea that I have to monitor my account every day and notify the bank of any unauthorized activity within 24 hours is outrageous, especially on an account that has not had authorized transactions for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( with the exception of a deposit and transfers made because of this potentially fraudulent activity ). 9 ) I checked the account on XX/XX/XXXX to see if a deposit made on XX/XX/XXXX had been posted. Even though I 've been making deposits for more than 20 years from the same highly reputable source, Wells Fargo often arbitrarily puts holds on deposits. So I do check those. 10 ) I notified Wells Fargo of the unauthorized charged before receiving a statement for the month.

Following my Disputes regarding this Matter with numerous Consumer agencies, I observed that XXXX, as of XX/XX/XXXX, removed the inappropriate reporting 's of "" Collection '' from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, a total of XXXX reporting 's removed.   However, XXXX continues to report ( as well as inappropriately reports ) this same Matter as being a Brand-new Collection as of XX/XX/XXXX.   This is a lie.   If Portfolio Recovery reported this was a Brand-new Collection beginning in XX/XX/XXXX ( 11 months ago ), IT IS NOT a Brand-new collection almost one year later, in XX/XX/XXXX.   This is nothing more than an underhanded maneuver by Portfolio Recovery to "" update '' this alleged Matter by one year, thereby significantly increasing the negative effect on my credit scores.   Further, as Portfolio Recovery has removed the XXXX ( XXXX ) highly inappropriate reporting 's following my Disputes of this Matter, this would clearly indicate that the prior reporting by Portfolio Recovery was in fact inappropriate ; that is why they removed it.   This would bring significant doubt as to the credibility of Portfolio Recovery, and their credit reporting, as a whole.   Last but not least, Portfolio Recovery reports an alleged balance of {$2000.00} owing on this alleged Collection account, to XXXX.   However, at XXXX, an alleged balance of approximately {$1400.00} is reported ; a difference of nearly XXXX XXXX dollars.   This represents a very significant discrepancy in credit reporting between XXXX different bureaus, by the same alleged creditor.   Given the multiple occurrences of contradictions and discrepancies in their reporting of this alleged Matter, I respectfully request this Matter be fully removed from all major credit reporting bureaus.

I contacted Chase for help & made several attempts at getting a mod approved. All my attempts were met with opposition from Chase & while I worked hard to get a mod Chase was simultaneously working just as hard to foreclosure, even though they did not have my note. At one point I was given a trial payment of $ 2300.00/mth, & even after the trial period was over I continued to make the payments, but the loan mod never came. I eventually hired an attny to help in getting Chase to mod my loan. The attny took my money, did little or nothing for me & was later disbarred. To demonstrate my ability & willingness to pay, I made monthly payments based on the amount that appeared on the notices that I received each year my loan adjusted, usually approx $ 800.00/mth. I was later told by one of Chase Reps that it did not really make sense for me to continue paying because that money was just going to a suspense account & would eventually be lost as they were not approving me for a loan mod. While I was still trying to get Chase to modify my loan, they set a sale date, and in order to stop the sale I had no choice but to file a ch.XXXX BK, with hopes of getting a mod during the BK. Due to my lack of knowledge and understanding of the BK process & paperwork, I did not realize that the BK attny surrendered the same home that I filed BK to keep. I contacted Chase regarding applying for a mod again during the BK period & was told that I needed a letter from my BK attny in order for them to speak with me. I got the letter but they did not speak with me until the BK was discharged. I was working with the rep at Chase to get a mod on one hand, while on the other hand Chase was setting another sale date. I now understand that this is called DUAL TRACKING, when they pretend to be helping you while at the same time continuing to foreclose or sell your property. Chase did this during the entire time I was trying to get a mod. The representative at Chase told me that I was preapproved for the mod and that she needed XXXX correction on my P & L. She told me that she requested their attny to stop the sale, allowing me to complete the mod. In getting the corrected P & L to her, I was not allowed to send it by email, I had to fax it to the rep.

Prior to the sale date, I went to the court to make sure that the bank 's attny had filed a motion to stop the sale and to file my own motion for an emergency hearing for the judge to stop the sale and allow time for the mod process to be completed. When I got to the court, I found that the bank 's attny did file a motion to stop the sale, but the judge had stamped the order "" HEARING REQUIRED '' & the sale was not postponed. I filed my own motion for an emergency hearing but the judge did not allow an emergency hearing, instead he stamped my order "" HEARING REQUIRED '' as well and allowed the sale to take place. After the sale, not realizing that I should have filed an objection to the sale, instead I filed a motion to vacate the sale & the judge denied it.

I just tried several times to reach it at a so-called customer service number ( XXXX ). It is impossible to reach anyone there, as there are numerous phone loop recordings at that number. Among other things, Macy 's lowered my credit limit, allegedly because XXXX provided it with a false credit report. It should have gotten a ( partially ) corrected copy of it by now, as I asked XXXX several times to provide one. However, throughout the last year, Macy 's continued with numerous, habitual errors, even after I called several times to correct it and was told that it was corrected. For example, it habitually mailed checks for balances on my account, then treated my account as though I cashed the check with the credit balance when I did not. I would call Macy 's about this, with little to no avail. Macy 's continued to show less on my account even when I had overpaid it and had a balance on it, with the difference explained by a lost or uncashed check, often one that I 'd told Macy 's about. Then when it received no additional payment, it charged me phony late fees. I would call to have that corrected and often was told that it would be when it was not. One example appears to be a {$2.00} charge from XXXX XXXX, 2015 that I should not have. Add to these problems ( of claiming that uncashed checks eliminated credit balances, then using that to charge illicit fees ), as is the case today, no one can be reached at the numbers printed on bills, so there is no way to verify even the false balances Macy 's has been attributing to me throughout the last year or longer. As I write, I just heard a recorded voice tell me that my balance was {$73.00} and change, but I have little idea of what explains it, since I have not gotten a bill and can not reach anyone at their so-called customer service center. I have not gotten a bill from Macy 's in months and can not reach anyone there to discuss this and other problems. I should not have to roll dice to decide what to pay Macy 's, if anything, but that is what I am having to do.  ",Citibank,NJ,7000.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

64777,Credit card,,Credit card protection / Debt protection,,"About XXXX years ago, i received a credit card of {$300.00} issued by HSBC, with 0 % financing for a year. I purchased insurance on the account, as I was afraid of being layed off ( I am an older worker ). I was told at the time, by phone, by the insurance company and HSBC, that if I became unemployed, the insurance would pay off my account. A month or two later, I was layed off due to my illness, and initiated the program, providing the information needed to both companies. When I returned to work XXXX months later, the program ended, and when I checked my balance, I still owed about {$300.00}. When I inquired with the insurance, they claimed that they payed out around {$30.00} a month for nine months, or around {$270.00}. When i inquired about the account with HSBC, they said they dropped the interest rate when they froze the account. Now if the insurance company was paying at least the minimum on the account, why did the HSBC change the interest rate without informing me? This product was sold to me with the intention of preserving my credit by paying on this account, and was misrepresented by both parties involved. To make this story worse, HSBC was bought by Capitol One. I discovered this after I got a call from Capitol One saying I need to send a payment on my account. I told them, I do n't have a Capitol One account, wherein they told me that my account was purchased by HSBC. I told them of the problems with HSBC, and they told me, that they had no idea where that money went, but that Capitol One purchased the account. I told them that I have already paid via my insurance on that account, and the amount owed should have been less than a XXXX bucks, not the {$300.00} they claim as the balance. They claimed to know nothing about my situation, so I tell them I am not paying them money I do not owe. Flash forward to today : its been years since that conversation, Capitol One has accessed late fees on a credit card account I do not own. This was then turned over to an odious collection agency called XXXX XXXX, after upping the ante from {$300.00} to {$500.00}. I have told these people for years I am not paying them, and will not. I may one day settle this, but its not going to be for {$300.00} or {$500.00}, it will be for the amount owed on the original account, minus the amount paid by the insurance. In the years between, I have purchased cars, and other items with credit, paying them off in a timely manner. Recently, I have left work again, due to my health problems, and have related this to XXXX XXXX, who still wants to collect for Capitol One. They wanted me to put an account of this in writing to them, but I have instead opted to put an account of this in writing to you, in the hopes you will forward the complaint to both Capitol One and XXXX XXXX. If my failing health and employment issues do not sway them to write this off, then the next window to conclude this chapter is XXXX 2016, when I file and receive my meager income tax return, wherein I will offer again, to pay the original amount due, minus the money paid by my insurance to whoever is collecting it.

64856,Credit card,,APR or interest rate,,"To Whom It May Concern, Good morning. Please, I am seeking help with inquiring into a balance that has become outstanding with the company Capital One.  I opened this account 14 years ago in XX/XX/XXXX. It was my very first account to begin a credit history and this during my enrollment into college. I have diligently paid on this account and never in any lien for 14 years. I have already paid off the student loans years ago because their interest practices were subsequently fair.  I have opened other accounts over the years ( car insurance, other emergency credit cards, etc. ) All United States companies. Every other interest-based company I 've ever dealt with in United States has, following my establishing a good payment standing, automatically lowered my variable-interest rates ( not my credit limit ) or continued seeking ways to offer me waived potential fees ( such as removing inflated operating fees ), to reward my good payment history, help pay principal and keep me as a customer. They would seemingly also do these so their federal and consumer-protection practices remained compliant.  During all these events, I have never once for 14 years, been offered any reductions or adjustments or anything offered from Capital One. I understand it was my first card years ago. But, the APR is not fixed. Interest raised the principal to the point where I could not easily transfer the balance years ago. I then tried to stop the card. The majority of my current balance with them is purely, once again, interest. I have not encountered this with other non-fixed APR-based companies. Over {$1000.00} from multiple interest and other fees accumulates every 11 months for years now. Although, I had never made lengthy late payments to warrant it and maintained a XXXX FICO score all years leading to this.  Please see then also attachment. The balance reflects not the small total purchases made with this card annually, but reflects totals largely derived from interest.  The only reprieve came when current federal administration stimulus plan lowered and capped rates on existing accounts following the banking, automotive and housing bailouts of recent years. But, it was short-term. The administration 's regulations on banking expired ( seemed not more than 6-9months ) and the interest rate resumed.  So, please I would request assistance because I do not know how to address the matter. Thank you. Please, I would like to inquire for any help checking into the matter, especially ( but not limited to ) of certain interest policies with the company Capital One. Thank you so much for any help you can provide.    Best Regards, -Name omitted as per request of CFPB-P.S. The account is outstanding. Otherwise, I have XXXX liens or outstanding debts.

Unfortunately for me, Navient wanted {$900.00} a month in payments. I called to have them lower the payments ( I was willing to accept a longer payment term and, therefore, more money paid in the end ), but they could only bring me down to {$450.00} a month ( and this is an interest-only payment plan, meaning I am not making a dent in the principal amount ).

64907,Credit card,,Credit determination,,"XXXX XXXX - Twice now I have submitted an application to obtain a Macy 's Department Store Credit Card and have been declined for failure to clear an initial fraud alert I have placed on my Credit Bureau. I work in the financial services industry and understand how Fraud Alerts work. I have very good credit ( XXXX score ), and should easily be able to obtain an approval for a store credit card. As a result of my good credit and in an effort to keep it that way, I have placed an initial alert on my credit report to contact me at my primary cell phone number ( home number secondarily ).  The first time I applied ( around XXXX 2015 ), I was standing in the store and submitted and application at the point of sale. As I stood there for several minutes with my cell phone in hand waiting for a call to clear the alert, I eventually had the clerk call the credit department who informed me that I was declined because I did n't answer the phone when they called. My cell phone was in my hand the entire time and had maximum signal ( and I confirmed, they did not call my home number by mistake ). I asked them to retry and they said they ca n't - "" you get one try only ''. After arguing with them and asking to speak to a supervisor, I eventually gave up due to the line forming behind me in-store. I was told that I had to wait 30 days ( I believe ) to reapply - at the time, my frustration about the situation made me think that there is no way I would ever reapply for a Macy 's card.  A couple months later I decided to try again, because without a Macy 's card you are forced to pay higher prices for purchases - which is a primary concern of mine here. My second attempt in XXXX 2015 was around XXXX Pacific time from my home computer. I reapplied online and had my cellphone sitting by my side the entire time, waiting for it to ring. It did n't. I soon received an email saying my application was suspended until further information could be obtained - it included a customer service number where I learned that they were only open until XXXX EASTERN time ; and therefore, I had to wait until the next day. Sometime around XXXX the next day, Macy 's credit call while I was in the shower ; no message was left, but I reverse dialed the number and confirmed it was in fact Macy 's Credit Department. I then called the customer service line and was told the same thing again - one try to clear the alert and then you 're declined. I again argued with the CSR and eventually asked to speak to a manager. XXXX ( supervisor ) came on the line and explained to me that their system prevents them from clearing an alert after the one-attempt had failed and that I could reapply in "" X '' days ( I do n't remember, I think he said 30 day ). I asked to speak to a SVP or higher, which was declined. I hung up in utter frustration.  My concern here is that I 'm being forced to pay more for items at Macy 's because of their inflexible and unfair credit issuing practices ( generally Macy 's card holders save XXXX % on purchases ). I have great credit, a lot of disposable income and am a very responsible credit user. Macy 's practices are flawed and they need to be investigated and corrected as a result. Can you please let me know what you can do for me ( and countless others ) in this situation? I question the entire industry practice of discounting for Store Card holders if they 're not going to apply fair lending practices.  Thank you XXXX XXXX, I look forward to the CFPB 's response.

After months of attempting to obtain my credit report, I have heard nothing since submitting copies of my identification over XXXX weeks ago.   I have received multiple notifications from merchants that my credit card information has been compromised and have been attempting for months to get a copy of my credit report. The credit reporting agencies appear to be manipulating the system to make it very difficult actually to receive a report. First, I attempted to get a credit report from the website. One of the required questions was the exact amount of the payment on a car loan that was paid off more than ten years ago. Next, I attempted to order a report by telephone and was told by the system that I had to write in. Then, I wrote in and eventually received a form letter claiming that my address was unknown. My address is a house that I own and have carried a mortgage on for XXXX years ; the mortgage itself - with my home address - is surely on my credit report. The response is wholly implausible. Nevertheless, I wrote in over a month ago ( XX/XX/XXXX ) providing, as requested, a copy of my driver 's license and my Social Security card. I have received no response.   Equifax 's conditioning the required free credit report on information no one would reasonably be expected to possess ( the amount of the monthly payment on a loan closed for over a decade ), the claim that easily verifiable information ( the address of a house on which I have had a mortgage since 2002 and for which I have all the standard utility accounts ), and the failure to respond even after I have provided all requested documentation following multiple attempts over months - all while I have been told by credit card processors that my information has been compromised and I should check my credit reports immediately - is inexcusable and, taken together, raises strong inferences of a deliberate attempt to comply in form with the requirement to provide credit reports while in practice making it as difficult and burdensome as possible to obtain those reports. I also note that I have been offered "" credit monitoring '' and other paid services along the way ( for example, "" Equifax Complete '' ). I suggest that the credit bureaus be prohibited from offering paid consumer credit monitoring services in order to remove the obvious conflict of interest giving them every incentive to make it difficult for consumers to obtain the statutorily mandated free reports and drive them to the paid services.

65133,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"Me and my daughter 's Bank of American account was involved in a very elaborate fraud scam. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX check s in the amounts {$4900.00} and {$4900.00} were deposited into our account at an ATM located in XXXX, XXXX ; which neither of us resides in. I live in XXXX, XXXX and my daughter attends college in XXXX, XXXX. The checks that were deposited were XXXX checks drawn from a BOA account. The following day XXXX men came to my daughter 's apartment, presented their XXXX business cards and told her that XXXX accidently wired almost $ XXXX into her account and that they were there to collect the money. She was unaware of the deposit at the time but checked her account and confirmed what the men said was true. She is a XXXX XXXX XXXX college student who was taught not to question authority so she did what they told her to do. Because she is so naive of banking, she thought bank withdrawals had daily limits like ATM withdrawal so she withdrew half the money at one bank and the other half from another branch and gave it to them. Two days later, XXXX returned the checks back to BOA ; which resulted in our account being overdrawn for {$9700.00} and they deactivated my ATM card for all my accounts ; which is how I was notified of the fraud. I immediately submitted a fraud claim with the bank to conduct an investigation. About a week later an investigator called my daughter who conferenced me on the call. BOA pulled the camera footage for the ATM where the checks were deposited and were able to confirm that the deposits were s made by a man, the investigator told us that the man had been implicated in other investigation conducted by Bank of America however they only had his image but did not know who he was. The investigator was trying to intimidate my daughter by insinuating that she was part of the fraud ; by questioning why she made XXXX withdrawals as well as how the men would know where she lived. After the call with the investigator I went on line and did a people search under my daughter 's name ; which showed that she resides in XXXX, XXXX and for {$7.00} I could have purchased a full report ; which included her full address. It was a completely unbiased investigation ; any criminal can infiltrate our personal information from the internet ; which is why identity theft is such a security threat to us all. Although BOA did confirm that the checks deposited were not done by me or my daughter nor was it my daughter signature on the check ; they denied the claim and are now holding us responsible for repayment of all the money, they submitted us to XXXX and have closed the account. They have refused to take any responsibility for their lack of due diligence.  Initially we did not see the purpose of filing a police report as we felt nothing would come from it and no matter what the results of the police investigation, Bank of America would still holding us responsible for the repayment of the money. However after speaking to a Consumer Protection attorney, he advised me to submit a police report to have it on record that a fraud was committed against us.  BOA should be held responsible for not doing their due diligence to protect us by neglected to identify the below red flags : 1. The deposits were made at an ATM outside of the states the either of us live in 2. The unusualness of a deposits so large in student accounts when the average balance is only {$400.00} 3. Their failure to confirm account holder signature 4. Their failure to not place such large checks on hold to confirm funds and/or the legitimacy of the checks before releasing the funds into our account 5.

I completed a title loan with this company a little over a year ago. I made payments per the agreement each month until XX/XX/XXXX when I was forced into XXXX and unable to work. During that time I attempted on numerous occasions to try and rectify a remaining balance with this company for about {$1100.00}. Due to my unemployment circumstances I was only receiving a small amount of money a week from the state. I contacted this company and have been verbally abused, treated unprofessionally, and threatened with legal action up to and including jail by this company and its affiliates. I have tried numerous times to pay this company {$100.00} a week from my unemployment compensation until the balance is paid. Which per the amount would be just shy of 3 months. However over the past 30-45 days I continue to receive harassing phone calls by the company refusing to accept resolution payments, but also by the recovery company which they have hired that continues to call me at various hours outside of the FDCPA allowed XXXX-XXXX, making threats of Jail and Lawsuit. Going so far as to represent themselves as a state/federal agent for the purpose of threatening and attempting to instill fear and confusion. I am absolutely appalled that a company would not only flat out deny money being paid to them, but do so in an attempt to make erroneous statements and cause undue stress and frustration. If they are unwilling to accept resolution options than I am at a loss for how else to rectify this situation and stop these repeated threats and harassment. No company should be able to attempt to bully a consumer, especially when the consumer is trying to resolve the issue, just in terms that may be more specific to my needs at this time. I am not attempting to avoid the matter but can not continue to deal with the stress and aggravation of dealing with a company who refuses such resolution.

65311,Debt collection,Mortgage,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"We are filing a dispute regarding the failure for Bank of America ( BAC ) to complete a modification review under Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ).  Our loan was originated in XXXX with XXXX Mortgage Company, which in deed makes our family eligible for the review of HAMP programs and all of the programs original intent and initiatives for benefit of homeowner such as myself. It is unlawful on multiple levels for our loan to be discriminated and excluded from review of such programs based on XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) being named as investor/owner for our mortgage loan. Although we are thankful for consideration and approval of a modification program, we are dishearten by the fact that BAC, and XXXX are purposely overlooking our family for a much more beneficial program than what has been offered on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.  The reasons given for our multiple denials of HAMP not only are ambiguous, but also evasive and without detail or relevant cause and appear to be a ploy to avoid offering our family a deeper savings at 31 % of our gross income. My theory, is that both BAC and OLS presumed the HAMP program to be dissolved at the end of XXXX, and the denials were a preemptive decision made prior to the FHFA 's announcement made that HAMP was being extended until the end of XXXX.   Both BAC and XXXX, are major participants of the HAMP program and it is completely out of character of industry standards since XXXX and in the wake of both financial institutes losing federal lawsuits for thousands of acts of deception, abuse and fraud of homeowners nationwide. In fact there are still thousands of pending and unresolved lawsuits against of XXXX. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) engaged in a deceptive scheme to delay or deny permanent mortgage loan modifications through the federal Home Affordable Modification Program ( "" HAMP '' ) to desperate homeowners, systematically breaching their contractual obligations to homeowners, committing deceptive trade practices, and causing significant financial harm.   Our loan was approved of what 's called a Bank of America loan modification, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for a payment in the amount of {$1200.00}. Based on my gross qualifying monthly income of {$3500.00}, the payment equates to a front end debt to income ( DTI ) ratio of 36 % to 40 %. However, had our loan been reviewed accordingly for the HAMP program, our payments would be based upon 31 % DTI, equating to a much more affordable amount of {$1000.00}.   We are seeking for our loan to be reconsidered for the HAMP program. We are seeking a more thorough and detailed explanation as to why we are being overlooked for a program that we rightfully should be considered and qualified to receive. This complaint will be forwarded to the our state attorney general as well as Michigan Department of Financial Institution for their review of my grievances.

I explained to the representative that I was a single mother on XXXX and I could not afford that extreme APR increase. I immediately cut up the card and threw it in the garbage. I made two payments to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX a second time and asked for a supervisor. I was rerouted to another customer service representative from the company 's hardship program. I spoke to the representative at that time who informed me that I would qualify for their hardship program. She explained to me that their company would lower my APR and I could make lower monthly payments until the bill was paid off in full.

All in all a fabulous deal and since our home now would sell for around {$400000.00} we are depending on it for our retirement in the next 2 years. I am XXXX and my wife is XXXX   A few months after we got the modification, I was diagnosed with XXXX and right after that, XXXX XXXX and then a XXXX. Fortunately, after XXXX, XXXX, I am now XXXX ( for now ) and still have most of XXXX XXXX. However, during the time I was being treated I got behind two payments on my mortgage and have been two payments behind for a year although I have made a full payment each month on time for the past twelve months.   Here is the problem. My modification says that if I am past due three months and are still past due on the last day of the third month, I would be in default. I have attached a page from the modification and the part I am referring to is in paragraph XXXX. In the past year, I have made the monthly payment several times on the last day of the third month by XXXX XXXX and there has never been a problem. Last XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I sent through XXXX XXXX a full payment to Ocwen which they admit they received but they refused to accept it and sent it back. They said I was XXXX days past due and they ca n't accept any payments after XXXX days. Apparently the problem was caused by XXXX days in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX so that plus XXXX days in XX/XX/XXXX made XXXX days past due. It is interesting though that I made the XX/XX/XXXX payment the last day of the month as well and they accepted it even though that one was also XXXX days past due just like the XX/XX/XXXX one which they rejected..   I told them what the Agreement says and that nowhere does it say 90 days. Their answer was that when they say 90 days, they assume the end of any third month would be 90 days. YES ... ... they actually said that! I have talked to several people at Ocwen and they all recite the speech about 90 days.They refused to accept my payment based on what they admit is an internal policy of 90 days and it is contrary to the terms of the modification. Also, by accepting a payment that was XXXX days past due in XX/XX/XXXX and then refusing a payment 92 days past due in XX/XX/XXXX, they have contradicted their own policy.  Of course they are now threatening foreclosure if I do n't reinstate the modification with {$7500.00} which I do n't have, or they want me to apply for a new modification. I have several problems with that. First, the original modification was based on the appraised value of our home two years ago. It has gone up since then so with a new modification would be based on a current appraisal and we would probably lose the equity we have. Also, while going through all of the medical problems, we got behind on most of our bills ; not for big amounts but spread over XXXX or XXXX creditors. It probably does n't add up to more than $ 5k total but it looks bad on a credit report so we might not get approved for a new modification.

I was told that I should apply as the interest rates were better and I could get a better rate and possibly an increase in the loan amount. There was absolutely NO discussion that the entire type of loan would change.  I wanted to ensure that nothing be taken out of the loan at closing, so I made sure all of my credit card had a XXXX balance at closing.  On my old loan, the last Outstanding Variable balance was {$220000.00} based on my XX/XX/XXXX statement.  On my new loan, at closing, the balance was {$220000.00}. When I questioned the person handling the closing, I was unable to get a clear answer from him why the balance was different. He clearly did not know. There was nothing to be charged against except for the {$450.00} early termination fee of the previous loan.  On XXXX XXXX, XXXX there was a {$3000.00} deposit made into my checking account from my credit line. I did not make nor authorize this transaction. When I called the loan department, I was told it was a mistake and it would be credited back into my credit line.  On XXXX XXXX, XXXX it was credited back.  On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I noticed a {$450.00} debit made to my checking account for a Line Payment. I went back to the bank and asked what this was about. Once again, nobody could give me an answer and after them calling the loan department, found out that this was the early termination fee that was already charged on the closing date of the loan. I was told that I would be credited back that money plus {$53.00} in errors nobody could explain to me.  On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, {$450.00} was credited back to my checking account.  On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, {$43.00} was credited back to checking account - not the {$53.00} that they said would be.  On XXXX XXXX, my first payment was due on this new loan. They automatically withdrew {$560.00} from my checking account for Interest Only which is the type of loan I have always had ( this is my third Bank of America Home Equity Loan ).  I received my XX/XX/XXXX statement last week and noticed that on XXXX XXXX, they will be withdrawing {$900.00}. When I questioned this, I was told that I had agreed to a new loan that required both interest and principle to be paid monthly.  Why would anyone in their right mind accept a loan that is giving them a XXXX point less in interest but requires double payment each month? Who would accept these terms?  Second question - why was the XXXX payment in line with all the payments I had paid previously and then doubled on the second payment of the loan?  Now, I will need to borrow against the loan in order to pay back both the principal monthly. This loan was taken to pay for college which I now have to borrow against to pay monthly as I ca n't afford to pay principal while I 'm still paying for college. As with my other loans, I expected to pay for the principal from the equity in my home once I sell my house.  There have been problems with this loan since day one and I was clearly misrepresented and misinformed on the loan.  After contacting the branch manager last week, she expedited this and got back to me about all the charges that they were unable to explain to me over the first couple of weeks with the loan. This is the least of the problems. The problem is the change in the loan and having to pay principal which they said was discussed which is clearly false.

I was verbally informed that i paid everything owed and therefore assumed my bill was fully settled. Several months later i got a call from a debt collector, Rent Recovery Solutions, stating that i owed {$720.00} for various reasons. I never received a bill from the XXXX complex nor did they attempt to contact me regarding this bill at any point. After requesting an itemized bill from the debt collector i concluded that i owed a partial months rent which i paid. That brought the balance down to {$440.00} which the apartment complex claimed were damages done to the apartment. I am disputing this for several reasons. 1. There was no move in inspection performed when i took control of the property. 2. There was no move out inspection performed and therefore my signature is not present on the billing document. 3. I know that there was no move out inspection performed for the previous tenant as i am friends with him. 4. One of the items on the bill was marked as damage several months after moving out, this is not allowed by Georgia law. For these reasons there is no way for the apartment complex to accurately say i caused any of these damages. In addition Georgia law states that the complex is required to give me an itemized list of any damages upon move in, this was not provided. Georgia law also states that i must be present during the move-out inspection and sign the document to ensure an accurate list is maintained, i was not informed of any move out inspection and the documents sent to me do not contain a move out inspection, only a bill.Georgia Law also states that a move out inspection must be performed within three business days after moving out. One of the items on the list was added almost three weeks after moving out.

Approximately three months ago we submitted a hazard insurance claim on our home to XXXX XXXX Insurance to allow for repairs to the roof, siding, windows, and fence which occurred in XXXX 2014. The claim was quickly processed by XXXX XXXX and we received a check for the damages in the amount of approximately {$12000.00} ( depreciated value ) of a total claim of XXXX. We were required to have Pinnacle Mortgage endorse the check. We contacted Pinnacle for instructions on how to obtain their endorsement and proceed with ordering/paying for repairs. We were instructed in writing that we would need to endorse the check over to Pinnacle and submit proof of 100 % completion of repairs to receive distribution of funds. We called to inquire as we could not complete or start repairs without funds from the claim. We were told that even though the written requirements indicate a need for a certificate of completion, that in fact that was not true and we could simply endorse the check over to them and upon receipt they would initially re-issue us XXXX of the funds with the XXXX XXXX issued with proof that the work was 50 % complete, and the final XXXX upon proof that the work was 100 % complete. We were told however, that we could submit a formal request to have 100 % of the funds distributed immediately, which we deemed necessary due to the requirements for up-front payments in excess of the XXXX offered to us to our contractors. We submitted the formal written request for full disbursement in early XXXX. We provided all requested information, including the TIN for our contractor. After three weeks of no additional correspondence from Pinnacle we called and were told for the XXXX time that the request was not processed because we failed to provide our contractor 's TIN. At this time, we were told we would need to re-submit the request, but we asked if we could simply provide the TIN over the phone to expedite the process and were told we could. We provided the TIN over the phone and were told the request would be processed and we would receive our check for the {$12000.00} claim within XXXX5 business days. A few more weeks went by with no check and no additional correspondence from Pinnacle so we called to inquire as to the status. At this time we were told that our claim had been rejected. We asked what our options were because at this point we needed to pay our contractor for materials to allow work to begin. Pinnacle told us we could take XXXX of the distribution or we could re-submit a request for the entire {$12000.00}. So we requested a slightly smaller distribution of {$10000.00} be distributed to cover expected near term costs. Within one week of submitting this request Pinnacle called and said the request had been approved and we would receive a check in XXXX to 5 business days. After this, we waited 7 days and then we received a letter requesting that we call them because their records showed no work had been completed on the property and asking us to explain why.

It has now been 7 days and we have not received the check. We understand Pinnacle 's responsibility to protect the security of their mortgage and their need for controls to ensure insurance claims are used to make necessary repairs, but we also believe their delays and mismanagement in processing the claim are unfair and abusive under UDAAP.

I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options.  In early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months.  More paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical.  Wells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan.  My property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was.  They can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this.  I feel that I have been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and would like to pursue legal action against them based on negligence.

During a time period of almost 7 YEARS, from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, we were in the process of applying for the modification. We would call Chase, be told that our application was "" under review, '' then be told that our documents expired because the 60-day time period had passed, and we were forced to submit documents all over again. This cycle happened repeatedly. There were also lengthy and numerous delays caused by Chase ( e.g. waiting for their appraiser, etc. ). Importantly, during this time, interest and fees were accruing.  The final modification we are being offered is for a new principal balance of {$520000.00} and a monthly payment of {$4100.00}.  Our complaints about Chase are as follows : ( 1 ) The loan modification process took the extraordinarily unreasonable time of 7 years because Chase was not undertaking the modification process in good faith. This is prejudicial to us because interest and fees were accruing on our account during the entire 7-year period. If Chase had shown good faith, including processing our application in a timely manner, we would not have been forced to accumulate the high amount of interest and fees. ( See recent XXXX XXXX, XXXX decision XXXX XXXX Bank, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX NY Slip Op XXXX, Supreme Court, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX finding that plaintiff lender failed to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution pursuant to CPLR XXXX ( f ), in part because lender repeatedly claimed that the modification application was not complete ]. ) ( 2 ) We are unable to afford the new offered monthly payment of {$4100.00}. Our original monthly payment was {$4900.00}, so this new monthly payment is only a savings of {$750.00}. Furthermore, about half of the new payment is to cover our monthly escrow fee, which would not be as high, had we not accumulated so many fees and charges during the 7-year processing period.  ( 3 ) We were not considered for any programs other than HAMP. Per Chase, we were only considered for HAMP, not for any of the XXXX modification programs. As our application showed, our income is relatively high but our documented expenses ( associated with tenants on said property, and with basic living expenses ) are also high and are equal to almost half the value of our income. Chase explained to us that other programs such as XXXX look at both income and expense, whereas HAMP only looks at income. Had we been considered for XXXX of the other programs, which takes into account expenses, we might have been offered a more affordable monthly payment.  ( 4 ) The new principal balance they offer is {$520000.00}, which is higher than the current estimated value of our home. We had sent over to Chase more than XXXX Comparative Market Analysis ( "" CMA '' ) done by a licensed real estate broker that, as of XXXX, estimated the value of our home to be between {$380000.00} to {$400000.00}.  ( 5 ) We are not being given enough time to make a decision. We received the final modification offer on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and are told that a response is due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This 10-day period does not give us enough time to consult with an attorney or counselor about our options.  ",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,NY,10500.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

Bank of America recently responded with letter that has inaccurate information. This has been their pattern for 4 years. I am under the impression the Making Home Affordable program can help me reduce my payment to 31 % ( or less ) of my gross income.

Had Bank of America modified my loan 4 years ago, my payment would have been reduced approximately {$400.00} per month, but they have drug this out as my income has slowly increased and reducing my payment now would only result in a reduction of a few dollars - my ask is that this be done and that I be on a fixed rate loan, not an adjustable rate loan that can increase beyond my ability to pay. I have not asked for my principal to be reduced, only that my loan be modified to a fixed rate with a payment less than 31 % of my income.

Although I continued to send the necessary funds to her each month to cover that mortgage, she pocketed the money and did not pay. I asked my attorney if I could withhold those funds each month from her and pay the mortgage myself, at which time i was advised that it would be illegal to do so. So this went on for several months despite both my attorney and myself saying we would have to take this to court. After about XXXX months of non payment, we did take this to court in XXXX of 2012. She was found to be in contempt of court and ordered to bring the mortgage current within XXXX months and make the expected payments in the future. She ignored this court order and never paid a dime for the mortgage, despite my continuing to pay her the money to do so. This went on for a period of XXXX months until she put the house up for short sale. In the meantime my credit score continued to plument though no fault of my own.

65664,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"I wanted to bring to the CFPB the following instance where I think consumer protection needs to be applied. I bank with Bank of America. I utilize on-line banking for Bill Pay and for managing my finances. I have direct deposit and other features which I use on a regular basis. On the interface user platform website that consumers see when they log in to On-Line Bank is the listing of accounts. When you go into each account, you see a snapshot of your account, with summary, account balance, available history and then below that what is processing for that day and what has cleared. When you go to Bill-Pay Screen where customers can make automatic payments, there is outgoing payments box.   About two weeks ago, I instructed Bank of America to make payments to my children school, each totaling {$3100.00}. I, technically speaking, asked the bank to process and issue a check for me to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. I also a few weeks ago also asked the bank to process a payment for XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. Today, I checked my on-line banking account page and saw that my XXXX XXXX payment was "" processing '' and my account was deducted by the {$100.00}. But the payments made by Bank of America to my children 's school for {$3100.00} each were not showing up as "" processing. '' This is a considerable amount of funds that were essentially processed by the bank with a confirmation assigned by the bank for the transition. Yet, my on-line banking balance did not reflect anywhere this deducted amount as of XX/XX/XXXX.   When I inquired, the Bank of America customer service said that that they do n't on the bill pay side show on the summary account side processed checks that they were instructed to send as "" processing '' nor to they show this deduction anywhere in the on-line bank balance account summary or processing transactions. The only way you would know that these pending transactions were to be posted on XX/XX/XXXX were to go into Bill Pay. Then manually figure out your balance to know that you were not going to overdrawn when ACH clears at XXXX.   I bring this to your attention because I believe that any bank online user interface should be consumer friendly. No where would I know on my account summary that XXXX checks each for {$3100.00} were going to be debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX unless I remembered to check my bill pay page. The summary of my account page does not reflect these as "" processing '' payment even though I instructed the bank to send out or process these payments. If I did not have adequate funds or overdraft protection, I might run the risk of over drawing my account without realizing it because my account summary as of XX/XX/XXXX did not show these XXXX pending debits. The bank would then be able to charge me {$35.00} overdrafts and return checks. A consumer would have no way of knowing accurately what there bank account balance is as of the date payments are being sent and processed by the Bnak Please advise and to who I might talk to about this very frustrating and worrisome feature. Bank 's make most of their money off these types of consumer fees but, in fact, so consumers are accurately informed any consumer interface should be clear, accurate and reflect any and all transactions that the bank has been asked to process on behalf of the consumer / customer. I have screen shots I have shared with CFPB about what happened today on XX/XX/XXXX regarding account summary, processing transactions and bill pay.

Why did the requirement to release the cosigner name went from 12 continuous monthly payments to 24, 36 and 48. Why is there a need to check credit reports for the borrower and cosigner ( has no income now ) all over again. Does XXXX XXXX bank wants to punish the borrower and cosigner?

65694,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Making/receiving payments, sending money",,"I wrote a check for {$4200.00}. The date I wrote on the check was XXXX XXXX, 2015. At this date I would have had sufficient funds in my account. Wells Fargo allowed this check to be cashed on XXXX XXXX. This caused my account to be over withdrawn by {$800.00}. Had the check been cashed XXXX XXXX, my account would NOT be over-withdrawn. I made XXXX purchases the same day the check was cashed and these were subjected to {$35.00} overdraft fees. None of these purchases were more than {$20.00}. Wells Fargo reimbursed me in full for XXXX {$35.00} charge but will only reimburse me {$17.00} for each of the other XXXX {$35.00} fees. Wells Fargo should have bounced the check and not allowed my account to have been over withdrawn by {$800.00}. I should only be paying for XXXX returned item fee, which according to my research is {$35.00}. I spoke to a teller on the phone. She stated that when a customer has insufficient funds, sometimes this check is allowed to be cashed and sometimes it bounces. According to this teller, this decision is not made manually, but by a computer. Wells Fargo is not transparent about this particular algorithm, and they need to be. This is an issue of fair banking. If I were someone at WF and had to design an algorithm that decided whether the check should be cashed and the customer subjected to multiple over draft fees versus a check should bounce, it is obvious that the former would be preferable in my case. In the case of the former, Wells Fargo has opportunities to subject small purchases ( such as my XXXX purchases ALL under {$20.00} ) to multiple {$35.00} over draft fees before the customer realizes his/her account is over withdrawn. Of course Wells Fargo has an incentive NOT to bounce my check! This is what they should have done. Looking at my bank account, it is obvious I am not a wealthy customer and it is obvious I make many small transactions throughout the day. As far as I see, I am an ideal customer for charging multiple {$35.00} overdraft fees, as opposed to a single returned item fee. I do n't know if the WF algorithm that chooses "" cash '' or "" bounce '' factored these variables into their decision, but I and all Wells Fargo customers deserve to know so we can make informed decisions about our spending and informed decisions about who we chose as our bank.   I would also like to mention that Wells Fargo did not send me notification of insufficient funds until XXXX XXXX at XXXX.

After calling the customer service, I was told if there was any balance, it required paying the full balance for XXXX months to prevent any further interest charge.  Afterwards I read carefully on the statements, and realized that when the balance was not paid off on XX/XX/XXXX, Citi started to accrue the interest, not from XX/XX/XXXX, but from previous due date of XX/XX/XXXX. This calculation may be correct if the interest rate of previous month was already 18.99 %. But in this case, the interest rate of previous month should still be the promotional rate of 0.0 %.

Unlike other credit card companies that specifically states the date the promotional rate ends, Citi ambiguously states the rate ends in a certain billing period, with no specific date given. So Citi may argue the promotional rate ends at beginning of the billing period, rather than end of the billing period as we customers would assume.

The only part I was aware of is that I understood that there would be a higher incurred cost. Though the broker we worked with may not have done anything illegal ( I do not have any legal or property background ), I would consider what was done unethical. I considered this person to be unresponsive to the point where I was reaching out to him more often than he reached out to my fiance and I. He made critical mistakes on the application that could have been simply avoided such as citizenship status and other identification information. My fiance and I had to point out the issues with the application and changes made came on our end. This process was less than conducive to a new home buyer.   The worst part of this endeavor is when we tried shopping around for the best deal, which is our right to do so. We had a broker approach us about a particular rate and we asked the current broker we were using if he could match, giving him the opportunity to keep our business. He stated that he could without any mention of points. The other rate we were approached about had XXXX points. At this point, a few weeks went by after we had locked in our rate. We were unaware that the loan rate we locked in had points until it came time for closing and the cashier 's check we needed to pay was approximately {$4000.00} more than what we were quoted. We had not heard from him much during that elapse of time which was a period of approximately XXXX days. Due to previous arrangements made around house maintenance, we were cornered into paying this hefty amount which we would n't of had to pay if we switched brokers. There was n't any documentation sent to myself or my fiance, who are both borrowers on the loan, that there were any points. This was the only disappointing part of purchasing the home as the realty company/insurance company we worked with were exemplary.

This was my first time walking into a dealership without my parents there to assist me in this negotiation and the dealership was sure to take advantage of a young, XXXX female. I firmly believe I was given a raw deal due to my age, race and gender. Many car dealerships take advantage and jack up interest rates for minorities and I have no doubt this dealership practices these tactics.   I had so many issues with this dealership from the lease to the service to the return of the lease. The only bright spot was the last person I spoke to who apologized for the XXXX service I received all around from XXXX Mercedes.   Here are my gripes : 1. Leased a car at an extremely high rate because I did n't know the dealership put negative equity on the contract 2. The car sat on in the showroom for a long time so the key battery died, the car had some weird sticky residue on the passenger side door and the air pressure in the tires had to be corrected a week after I drove off the lot - I would think all of these should 've been checked or taken care prior to leaving ... at least that is the quality I would expect from Mercedes Benz 3. 27 month lease terms are a joke and a good way to get the consumer to pay for the car registration even though they only get to use it for 3 months of the year 4. This was my first lease and was not made aware of the disposition fee which is highway robbery at {$590.00}, oh but do n't for get to add the sales tax which brings it to just under {$650.00}. Nice 5. Multiple service department issues - making appointments but then being told the advisor I was assigned is on vacation, asking for a rental car but then getting told they did n't have any and I did n't reserve one 5. Difficult getting people to return a phone call when it 's time to turn in the lease. I was told to call back to schedule an appointment to return the car but could not get the Client Manager to return my phone call. I e-mailed and called 3 times and finally left a frustrated voicemail before I received a call back.  6. To top everything off, I received e-mails saying I was eligible for 5 months of payments waived ... well that 's great considering I had already finished my monthly payments. What a joke!   I expected much better service from Mercedes Benz of XXXX XXXX, Mercedes Benz especially because they are a luxury car brand with a good reputation.

65803,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"The mortgage lender, Pennymac Loan Services LLC has taken the following steps to ensure that they can file for foreclosure against me:1. They paid past due taxes on the property, to open up an escrow account and increase my mortgage. This was unnecessary, as the home was not under any tax lien, nor in danger of any tax liens with the city of XXXX, NJ. I was making payments quarterly to the city of XXXX. The city was aware that I was behind the taxes and only required me to pay a certain amount before the end of the year, to stay out of danger of a tax lien. I was ready to pay the requested tax amount to the city of XXXX, but the mortgage company intervened, requesting the past due tax in full or no payment at all.   2. After paying the tax bill, that they did not need to pay, the lender opened an Escrow account, to cover the taxes. The lender subsequently increased my mortgage payments from {$1600.00} to {$3200.00} per month.   3. The lender made the payment on the taxes on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX, but retroactively increased the past due mortgage payment for the month of XXXX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX from {$1600.00} to {$3200.00} and retroactively increased the past due mortgage payment for the month of XXXX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX from {$1600.00} to {$3200.00}. How can the mortgage owed for the month of XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX increase when the Escrow account was opened after these dates? What is to prevent the lender from retroactively increasing the mortgage payments for all the months of the entire year of XX/XX/XXXX or previous years?   4. The payment that I sent to cover the XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX was only applied to XXXX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage lender increased the past due amount of XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX from {$1600.00} to {$3200.00}, after I sent my payment. I did not sent enough to cover the new past due amount for XXXX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. Instead of applying a partial payment to XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX the mortgage lender applied all the money left from my payment to the Escrow account, without my knowledge.

65887,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"There are two separate issues that are worthy of a complaint. First, XXXX fraudulently collects "" processing fees '' for tolls. From XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2014, I passed a series of tolls on a single highway in Texas totaling {$17.00}. XXXX charged a {$15.00} "" processing fee '' for each toll, resulting in {$17.00} in tolls and {$90.00} for processing. I confirmed with Texas Tollways that fleet tolls are billed as a single transaction, so there is absolutely no way that XXXX had to address the toll more than once.   I paid the {$100.00} in full and then disputed {$75.00} with XXXX XXXX. XXXX ruled in my favor, refunded me {$75.00}, and charged back {$75.00} to XXXX XXXX specifically XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Without notifying me, XXXX sent the full {$100.00} plus a {$21.00} collections fee to the Retrieval Masters Creditors Bureau ( Collection Agency ) ( RMCB ).   I filed a dispute with RCMB immediately XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I followed up on XXXX XXXX, and XXXX had not yet responded to the dispute.   I spoke with XXXX on XXXX XXXX, and they insisted that on XXXX XXXX, XXXX had pulled back the full {$100.00} ( confirmation number XXXX ). XXXX insisted that they only pulled back {$75.00}, so I sent the attached email and documentation to XXXX on XXXX XXXX.   I heard nothing from XXXX ( despite a promise that they would address the issue within a week ) so on XXXX XXXX I logged into my XXXX account. I noticed that the full {$100.00} had been removed from my bill in increments, leaving a zero balance XXXX bill attached ).   Upon calling XXXX I discovered that XXXX had in fact pulled back only {$75.00}, so their sending me to collections for {$100.00} ( and then giving me confirmation codes as proof ) was either done fraudulently or due to incompetence.   XXXX also said that they had decided to opt me in to the "" Plate Pass '' retroactively for {$68.00}, and that after giving me credit for what was n't charged back, I had a zero balance. They have only received {$32.00} from me, so this does not add up. I believe they are trying to cover their tracks and appease me so that I drop the case.   I did a final follow up with RCMB and verified that the full amount was dismissed as a mistake - that I no longer have any amount in collections and that the case is closed.   As a XXXX member with a security clearance, this has been a complete nightmare for me. In addition to having to report this to my security personnel, I now have to disclose this as a "" financial responsibility '' issue from now on. It will now have to be reviewed to determine my suitability for access to special programs. I have attached a sample copy of the form I now have to complete, where I am now grouped with "" garnished wages '' and "" bankruptcy '' despite my XXXX credit score.   To summarize, here is why I feel that CFPB should take action : -XXXX fraudulently charges processing fees without merit-XXXX does not respond to chargeback disputes and then sends bills to collections after losing a dispute-XXXX does not do due diligence to ensure they send the right amount to collections-Even if not reported to credit agencies, being sent to collections can have very negative consequences for a subset of consumers with special security situations  ","Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc.",DC,20000.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

Apparently this is not happened according to XXXX. I have several refi inquiries & also auto inquiries which I do not believe has been fed properly to XXXX who is determining my credit score. I need to get this straightened out so that my score can improve. The credit reporting agencies say I can not dispute a Inquiry. They say I must contact the company on the report ; find out who made the inquiry ; contact them and either ask them to remove it if it were in error or if it was not authorized by me. I have done this with several. Please note XXXX had pulled my credit on XXXX & XXXX /out my permission They say they will remove same. Others say they ca n't do it..So I am at a loss at what do do as each XXXX is XXXX points and is adversely affecting my credit Note : 1 ) XXXX pulled for XXXX Mortgage XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for refi within 30 days 2 ) XXXX pulled for Full Access Mtg XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX within 30 days 3 ) XXXX pulled for XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX Store XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for auto loan -- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX all within 30 days ; XXXX Bank which is NOW XXXX Bank had several different inquiries : XXXX Bank had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which seems crazy to have it pulled twice on the same day!!!

65976,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"INTRODUCTION On XXXX 2014 BORROWER applied and received a new real estate loan in the amount of {$300000.00}, from BANK OF AMERICA ( LENDER ). BORROWER was over charged by the LENDER in the amount of {$1100.00} for discount points for the specific interest rate chosen. The LENDER misrepresented the Good Faith Estimate ( GFE ) on the final XXXX statement.   GOOD FAITH ESTIMATE ( GFE ) On or about XXXX XXXX, 2014, BORROWER received from the LENDER an Interest Rate Conditions. See Exhibit XXXX attached hereto. The interest rate and the discount points were locked in at an interest rate of 4.625 % and a credit XXXX % or $ XXXX.   On or about XXXX XXXX, 2014, BORROWER received from the LENDER an Estimated Settlement Charge Summary. See Exhibit XXXX attached hereto. The Estimated Settlement Charge Summary also confirms the credit points in the amount of $ XXXX.   SETTLEMENT STATEMENT ( XXXX ) BORROWER received a misstated XXXX settlement statement. See Exhibit XXXX attached hereto.   LENDER IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR QUOTES LENDER is accountable for their quotes in a real estate transaction. The XXXX is a standardized document that list every expense involved in the real estate transaction and is presented to the borrower during the closing process. BORROWER was quoted in the GFE $ XXXX XXXX XXXX % of {$300000.00} ) discount points.   LENDER wrongfully stated the amount in the settlement statement on page XXXX, comparison of GFE and XXXX. The XXXX line number # XXXX should be - {$3600.00} and not - {$2500.00}. See Exhibit XXXX attached hereto.   0 % TOLERANCE If at the closing, any item in the 0 % tolerance category is higher on the corresponding section of the XXXX compared to the original GFE, the LENDER is responsible to cover the difference.  Charges that can not increase are : Origination charge # XXXX Credit or charge ( points ) for the specific interest rate chosen # XXXX Adjusted origination charges # XXXX Transfer taxes # XXXX It is clear that the LENDER over charged BORROWER by {$1100.00} by misstating the GFE and the XXXX with - {$2500.00} when the GFE clearing shows the amount should be - {$3600.00}.   CONCLUSION If at closing, any item in 0 % tolerance category is higher on the corresponding section of the XXXX compared to the original GFE, the LENDER is responsible to cover the difference. In this case the difference from - {$3600.00} and - {$2500.00} is {$1100.00}.   In the event a LENDER misses XXXX of the tolerances in the GFE, the LENDER is responsible to pay the difference. If the tolerances were missed, the settlement can proceed, and the LENDER has 30 days to compensate the BORROWER for the missed tolerance. The LENDER has had over 30 days to compensate the BORROWER in the amount of {$1100.00} and continues to refuse to pay the difference.   For at least these foregoing reasons, LENDER should pay BORROWER {$1100.00}.  ",Bank of America,CA,94300.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

Over the course of the next 10 months I made regular payments of {$95.00} every two weeks. A few times I paid off the loan completely, only to need to take it out again. In XXXX I signed up with a debt management program. Mobiloans denied the proposal, saying they do n't work with those. I was told they would not accept any payment discussions on my loan until I was 30 days late. Once at 30 days, I called back to again discuss payment arrangements. I was not trying to 'settle the debt ', I was trying to pay it back with arrangements I could handle in my budget. I was told I could pay {$950.00} in XXXX installments of {$470.00} each within 30 days and this would satisfy the remaining amount due of {$1300.00}. I was told this would be accepted as payment in full and release me from the remaining debt. At great hardship, I made these payments on time, for a grand total of {$5000.00} paid on {$3400.00} loaned.  During the entire time I was making on-time payments, nothing was reported to my credit report at all. As soon as I made the last payment of {$470.00}, my Transunion reported showed up with a Mobiloans account, of {$1300.00} Charged Off/Unpaid to Collections.  I immediately called, and was directed to email Mobiloans Disputes. Disputes told me they would change it to Charged Off/Balance {$0.00} because I had 'accepted a settlement '. At no time during the payment arrangements was I told this would report to my credit this negatively. Usually Charge Offs are reported when there are XXXX plus months of non payment. This was not the case.  I offered to pay the remainder of the amount they accepted as Paid in Full just to have this removed. They refused, saying it was my mistake that I chose the settlement option. I asked that they remove the Charge Off then as this was only hurting my credit, not them, as they 'd received {$1500.00} above the original loan paid back in full. I was told that they had to report 'accurately '. However, they had not reported 'accurately ' the amounts paid, nor the good payment history before the accepted final payment.

I decided to go to my local branch to talk to someone about signing up and getting a bonus for my new account. ( The person I spoke with and signed up through does n't work there anymore. ) The bank representative I spoke with in XXXX 2014 did some research and said that PNC offered a workplace referral bonus of {$200.00} for my employer. He told me that I had to meet XXXX requirements within 60 days : 1 ) XXXX online bill payment. 2 ) Sign up for online statements 3 ) Have XXXX direct deposit credited to my account.   Because I switched my direct deposit from another bank over to PNC it took 6 or 7 weeks to get my first direct deposit with PNC. About 4-5 weeks after signing up, I was concerned about how long the switch was taking, so I walked into PNC and spoke with a rep. This person explained that there was n't a hold up on their end, and as long as I had XXXX direct deposit within 60 days everything would be fine, and I 'd receive the bonus.   After the XXXX direct deposit hit my account ( the other requirements were already met ) I visited PNC bank to find out when I would receive me bonus. I was told that it could take a while, perhaps a month or two. Then about two weeks ago I went to PNC and sat with a representative to inquire about my bonus. He said that he 'd put a request in for someone to research my bonus code and requirements and someone would call me back. No one called me.   So yesterday, I explained the situation again to someone new at PNC over the phone and he followed up with me today to say that I did n't qualify for the bonus. He said I needed a total of {$1000.00} in direct deposits within the 60 days. I explained that this was n't communicated to me. He said there was nothing he could do. I called PNC 's XXXX number and spoke to XXXX different people who said the same thing. I was told that it was my word against someone else and there was nothing they could do.   Well I feel like a fool for getting the same information about the bonus requirements initially from XXXX different people at the same branch at PNC where I signed up, only to have been duped. I was n't given anything in writing that laid out the requirements for the bonus, and perhaps that should happen in the future. I based my expectations upon what was communicated to me when I first signed-up. I do n't think it 's fair for PNC to wash their hands of this. If you do n't issue something in writing that explains the bonus ( so that everything is clear ), then why should I be penalized if the representatives willfully or mistakenly gave me the wrong information. To make matters worse, XXXX XXXX XXXX offered a bonus of {$150.00} for a new direct deposit account ( with all the terms written out on paper ), and I turned that down to sign up with PNC. So now I 'm supposed to walk away with nothing. PNC needs to take some responsibility here and issue my bonus. Going forward they need to make sure that bonus terms are written out and given to the new account holder, so that this confusion does n't happen again.   I hope this gets resolved soon in my favor, because this whole experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth and has already wasted so much of my time.

Chase sent me an invitation for a new Slate card which I accepted with a credit line of {$5700.00}. I had a total credit line through Chase for {$27000.00}. Chase placed a 30 day late payment from me Slate card on my credit reports which I am trying to get removed. I have always paid my bills on time to Chase. This incident was not my fault as I never received any notification from Chase via paper or electronic statements. I informed them of this at the time and they were kind enough to credit the {$25.00} late fee and they understood the situation. Months later I found out that they placed a 30 day late on my credit reports which I am now trying to get removed on account ending in XXXX.   After months of trying to get this resolved I became very frustrated and upset with Chase and ended up closing all my accounts with them which I knew would take a hit to my credit. After taking a breather I reached back out to Chase to ask if they would reinstate my XXXX Marriott Chase account as I used this account a lot for business but also stated they could keep the other accounts closed. I was then denied credit for my Marriott account which made no sense to me when my credit was perfect. So I reached out to Chase again only for them to inform me I had delinquent credit through them from year 2000. I had no idea what they were talking about and asked them if this was really the case why in the world would you issue me credit after the fact with a total credit line of {$27000.00}. I then reached out to the Chase Executive Office to figure out what was going on and received a call back. Chase then agreed to reinstate only my Marriott account but not any of my other accounts. I only asked for the XXXX account to be reinstated so I was okay with that. It still however makes no sense and seems to me there is some sort of discrimination going on here when not offering me my credit back. I have been in banking for a very long time, working at XXXX, XXXX Bank, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and holding positions of Credit Manager, Credit Supervisor, Officer, VP, Underwriter, Accountant of Treasury Control and have never seen or experienced so much misunderstanding and inconsideration by any financial organization like Chase.

I also had a {$9500.00} balance on my Marriott credit card account which now that Chase reinstated the account for me I paid off in full which now has a credit balance of {$52.00}. My question to Chase is this, why would I after 15 years of being a customer of Chase have XXXX 30 day late payment unless I was unaware of proper communication from Chase? If I had a late payment to Chase then why did n't Chase contact me with a letter or a call from customer service like most banking institutions do for notification? If this was really my fault then why did Chase credit my late payment and recognize and apologize by phone that I never received any statements of notification? I had this Slate card for over a year and never had a late payment. I had other cards up to 15 years with never a late payment. I am only asking that Chase recognize the possibility that maybe just maybe this was not my fault and it is possible I was never notified in anyway of this situation. I would ask that Chase take this into consideration and please remove the 30 day late off my Slate account ending in XXXX. Thank you  ",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,MN,55900.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

Beginning in XXXX I noticed many inaccuracies accounts and records on my credit report when attempting to buy a house and I am concerned at the manner in which Transunion is dealing with them.   1 ) I called the company to dispute a 30 day and 60 day late showing under my XXXX account, which has been the primary reason for which my mortgage loan was denied. I was so upset I called and asked why they had not corrected the late payments after my mail-in dispute form and they gave me no options and no help. Then I called back the next day and it was already XXXX and I asked why this account was not corrected and why it had NOT updated in over two months and again they offered me no help besides telling me to take my concerns to the furnisher.

I am a young man with a family and need to purchase my home and i can not believe i waited all of this time to dispute these horrible mistakes.   2 ) I wrote them also, regarding a tax lien from XX/XX/XXXX that was filed in error much later. This lien was prematurely filed and they had not calculated the payments received in time which makes it invalid and illegal. This Lien is no longer in the Public Registrars Offices of California and I have written Transunion disputing it and they have told me that it must remain and yet they provided absolutely no documentation as to why and how. I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told that the lien was not on file and was filed in error on their part from an extension that was received in the year XX/XX/XXXX and that they had sent a "" Invalid Lien '' report with instructions to remove the record off of my file to the XXXX bureaus in XX/XX/XXXX.

How do you have the right to report this account and the refuse me a proper investigation and then claim it is verified yet provide me with absolutely no proof. Where are my investigation results?

When I went to the XXXX County Courthouse in XXXX, WV in XXXX, I understood in this case that I could just proceed to follow the will without the lengthy probate process. My uncle was never married, no children, no property. All I needed to do as Executrix was pay the bills which I had been doing for years ( my uncle was in the Veteran Nursing Home in XXXX, WV at the time of his death ) and disburse the funds according to the will. These funds by will, were to be divided XXXX ways between his XXXX siblings ( or their families if they had passed first ). This I have done with approximately {$21000.00} of the total approx. {$30000.00} that existed at the time of death. My problem now is that when I went to close the Huntington Bank accounts ( one was VA administered through me, one was personal and Social Security administered by me ) and place the approximately XXXX left at Huntington into the estate account at XXXX XXXX Bank to disburse to the heirs, Huntington froze the accounts. This is not consistent with logic. After Huntington was notified of my uncle 's passing in XXXX they continued to honor my checks in XXXX and XXXX but now they can not? Apparently for some reason, even though he passed, I was authorized to write checks for those months, but now I can not close the account.

When I called and inquired about my credit limit decrease, I was transferred to many people. XXXX agent was not understanding what I was saying and put in for a credit limit increase, when I simply was inquiring about the sudden decrease on my account. While trying to get clarification why an increase was made, the agent left the line and I was forced to call back.  After calling back, a manager then forwarded me to the credit management department where I spoke with XXXX. XXXX said that the decrease could have been from many factors, he told me the utilization rate was high ( 43 % ) and I have too many inquires ( I just bought a house ). In addition, he told me that my debt-to-income was too high. After I told him this was because my student loan income based repayment was not factored in, which would bring my DTI down to under 20 %, I offered to provide documentation for this but was told this would not be necessary. I explained to XXXX why I had n't used that card as much as I used to, specifically since I was working to pay it off based on my plan, as I have done in the past, he cut me off to tell me that he understood but in order to reinstate my limit, he would have to pull my report and review it. If he thought it was worthy, he would then pass it along to his Supervisor to review and make a decision regarding reinstating my former credit line.

66206,Credit card,,Credit determination,,"I am a XXXX single male whose primary income since XXXX has been XXXX ( under $ XXXX XXXX. When I first became XXXX in XXXX I ran into some credit problems that lasted for about 9 months. In XXXX XXXX I sold my home, paid off all creditors XXXX, and moved here XXXX to live with my younger brother. Because of the daily harassment that I experienced from creditors XXXX during that period, I swore off all banks and credit cards and since then have lived a very frugal but responsible life on less than half my prior accustomed income.   In XXXX XXXX my younger brother passed away and my older brother and I inherited his home ( with a $ XXXX mortgage ). That arrangement did n't work out and in XXXX I personally refinanced another XXXX ARM mortgage with the existing mortgage lender ( credit union ). This was done in order to finance a buyout settlement reached with my older brother - and with the intent to finish improvements on the house, sell it, and move back to a more affordable home XXXX ( now that I was left paying the full mortgage myself ).   Since that time I have also held a checking and XXXX savings accounts with the mortgage holder - ( State Employees Credit Union ( SECU ) - Contact Center XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) - with an average total monthly balances of around $ 5-10k. The mortgage, taxes and insurance, as well as all my utility payments - and all my fixed monthly bills - are deducted automatically from my checking account each month and I have never missed a payment on any of them.   Despite loathing banks and creditors since my unfortunate health experiences XXXX, yet realizing that it would be a good idea to re-establish credit, I opened a XXXX credit card account through that same bank ( SECU ) XX/XX/XXXX.   Since help with moving back to XXXX now seems improbable, I have decided to stay here XXXX and am now again trying to refinance the house to a 30 year fixed loan because the monthly payment has risen by over {$150.00} a month as the loan interest rose from 2.5 % to the current 4.75 %.   However, SECU does not offer 30 year fixed-rate mortgages, just 10 and 15 year and variable rate loans. So I am attempting to apply for a refinance loan with other banks now that 30-year rates are as low as 3.67 %. SECU includes a free quarterly FICO score report which has shown me having a FICO score in the XXXX to XXXX range.   So I assumed I was in good shape for a refinancing loan from a third party. However, I have now discovered that SECU has not been reporting my XXXX credit card history to XXXX of the XXXX credit agencies that all banks check when you apply for a loan. ( They were only reporting XXXX XXXX So both XXXX report my credit score as XXXX XXXX no credit history )!   I am basically being held hostage by SECU to the point that my only option is to refinance with them for yet another variable rate loan - or spend months opening even more credit cards in order to establish better credit record - hopefully before rates increase to the point that it is n't worth the bother.   You would think that my spotless record over the past 20 years of always paying my mortgage, insurance, and utility bills on time each month - and not buying things I ca n't afford to pay cash - would have an even bigger influence on my credit worthiness than big consumer spending habits of using credit cards to pay my bills.   THERE SHOULD BE A LAW requiring banks to report credit history to all XXXX of the credit agencies - or at least to disclose to potential customers of their credit cards that they will not be reporting to all XXXX agencies. If I had known this at the time I would have never opened the XXXX card with SECU - as my sole intent was to establish credit via a 'major ' revolving credit card.

As far as the total interest payment amounts, if I was to take a loan at 4 % on the {$50000.00} I should only expect to pay {$10000.00} in total interest over a 10 year term or {$16000.00} on a 15 year term. Again, I have already paid ( according to Navient ) {$25000.00} in interest over 113 payments on an original debt of {$50000.00}. Even including capitalized interest if I had a flat 4 % debt on the {$65000.00} I should only have paid {$20000.00} in interest over 14 years! I have already paid {$25000.00} interest in less than 10 years of payments at loans ranging from 3.5 % to 4 %. My payment average over the 113 payments of {$510.00} should have my original debt paid off at 120 payments with a total interest of {$10000.00}. Including the capitalized interest my debt should be paid off in 166 payments with a total interest of {$19000.00}.   To summarize, by XX/XX/XXXX I will have paid Navient {$100000.00} over 17 years on an original student debt amount of {$50000.00} with a interest rates on XXXX loans of 4 %, 4 %, 4 %, 3.5 %, 3.75 %, and 3.75 %. I was charged {$14000.00} in capitalized interest and have already paid {$25000.00} in interest according to Navient. In total I have made 113 monthly payments amounting to {$57000.00}. Navient took advantage of my attending XXXX XXXX to put me in deferment to increase the amount of capitalized interest on my loans, making it hard to enact payments on my loans at that time. The continual accrual of interest is not in line with the original loan amount and will end up being double the amount of the original loan amount at the time of scheduled repayment. I feel this lending practice of continual interest payments that inflate the total amount paid is predatory.  ","Navient Solutions, Inc.",MA,2100.0,Closed with explanation,Yes,

Received loan in XXXX and this has been the loan in which I have had so many fraudulent experiences with, with the maximum amount. Yet, being that I have had XXXX other loans with them in the past I know how payments should be applied.  On XXXX separate occasions I have paid additional money on the loan and realized that my number of payments had not decreased and final payment had not decreased. When extra money is paid in addition to what is due on the date I have always seen the funds be allocated in the manner which goes towards the back end of the loan reducing payments and number of payments.  On the first occasion when I informed a manager that the payments had been issued towards the next payment as well as the payment due and that was no how I wanted the funds distributed. In the past I have called and asked them to apply the funds towards the back end of the loan because that had not happened. The representative said she would do so but generally that is something they have no control over.  I waited to see the change and realized that the funds had been reversed which were applied to the upcoming payment, but was not applied anywhere else either. Still had same number of payments and amount. Called back various times throughout the week was told the allocation was a result of having a payment plan, the funds actually applied to the back end of your loan, we do not do re allocations for installment loans. And, finally a representative said I could receive a credit on the account as if I was being done a favor in regards to money I paid which they did not apply. I spoke to another representative and was told I could call in on the day payment is due and payment will go to back end of loan.  On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called to make my payment and opted to pay {$400.00} instead of {$190.00}. Number of payments did not change nor did payment date change. I definitely was aware that the funds did not allocate correctly. I was told it did not allocate correctly because you paid on your payment date and if you had called two days earlier we could have applied it to the back end. My payment of {$190.00} had been satisfied and I owed around {$89.00} for the upcoming payment.  I demanded a reallocation the representative stated that there was documentation which said that I was told that I had to call in two days before to have money applied to the back end. Which would be ludicrous because I would n't have turned right back around and wasted {$400.00} to have it not allocated in the way which would not best benefit me if I knew that and also because I have made payments on the actual day before and had them apply towards the back end.  After escalating to a manager I was able to explain to her and she said she could see that it was not allocated correctly. Her excuse was in order to have your desired results you will need to pay the loan off in full, which was n't answering my question about the allocation and later I was told every time it may allocate differently. Yet, she stated all additional payments go towards the back end which did not happen in my last XXXX cases.  To help solve the issue she credited the account {$100.00} dollars which reduced the month of payments by XXXX. Yet, she still acted as though she was doing me a favor.

At the time, she thought she had only used {$66000.00} of line of credit. In fact, XXXX XXXX, a Suntrust employee, without her authorization, took out the whole {$400000.00} line of credit on or about XX/XX/XXXX, and transferred it into a checking account opened in my mother 's name ( the "" Checking Account '' ).

She told me she had taken about {$67000.00} out through a HELOC, so I was confused when her statement said that the full {$400000.00} line of credit had been used. I eventually realized that the Checking Account had been opened, and explained what had happened to my mother. She said ( a ) that she had not authorized the transfer of {$400000.00} to the Checking Account, and ( b ) that did not realize that XXXX XXXX had transferred the entire {$400000.00} line of credit into the Checking Account on her behalf. We immediately transferred {$330000.00}, the entire balance of the Checking Account less {$1.00}, so that she would no longer be charged extra interest.

In addition, this logic is severely flawed as the primary mortgage holder has already approved the HAFA short sale and if OCWEN does not approve the HAFA short sale, then the house will enter foreclosure and OCWEN will get nothing. OCWEN holds the second mortgage on this townhouse. The first mortgage is held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The remaining principal with XXXX XXXX XXXX is {$380000.00}.

When the interest only period expires, my monthly payment will increase by {$1300.00} per month to {$2600.00} per month ( includes insurance and taxes ). When the XXXX mortgage adjusts, I will no longer be able to afford my monthly payments. At this point, my mortgage to gross income ratio will increase to 34 %. We also have excessive debt and monthly payments to care for our XXXX son. At this point, we will enter foreclosure as we will not be able to make our payments. I have explored all possible options. I do not qualify for any other Making Home Affordable ( MHA ) mortgage program, other than HAFA, because neither loan on the townhouse is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. Further, the outstanding balance owed on the house XXXX total of {$440000.00} XXXX exceeds the fair market value ( appraised in XXXX of 2015 for {$410000.00} XXXX.

Case number XXXX filed against Wells Fargo. While the original complaint outlines how I feel Wells Fargo did not help assist us in modifying our loan in a timely matter, but only after we felt we had to seek help elsewhere. We applied for modification in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX, but were placed in different programs, and were told we did not qualify for a modification. ( but never told why ) But when we reached out to a government funded program for help, and were approved, that 's when we were suddenly approved from Wells Fargo. This new complaint is to shed some light on the different things that Wells Fargo are continue to do to homeowners like ourselves who have done everything that Wells Fargo has asked, but are still being penalized. It 's simply "" not right ''. We tried once again to get a modification through Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX, but because we had such a bad experience the first time, we hired attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to assist us in the modification process. We ended up getting scammed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Which placed us in foreclosure. We felt we had no choice but to leave. Now we were out of {$3000.00} from being scammed from the Attorney, and we were being foreclosed on. The next thing we knew, Wells Fargo decided to modify our loan. But, now we are stuck in a lease agreement, and had just paid {$1200.00} to move. If we would have known, we would have never signed a lease. This is just a few example of how Wells Fargo operates. We are currently under review for a "" short sale ' on the property ( which we have a potential buyer ). But once again Wells Fargo is dragging their feet. They continue to request information that they already have. Delaying the process even more. I even have potential buyers for the property, but can not move forward with the sale, because of Wells Fargo. They gave me a deadline for their investigation. But informed me they needed more time. ( Letter attached ) But all the while I am receiving court papers in the mail for foreclosure. That 's just not right! How can you put me on a timeline with foreclosure court papers, but ask me to give you more time to do your investigation. And the investigation is about you not doing your job correctly. But how can I get a fair resolution to my complaints, when the one that I am complaining about, is the same one investigating the complaint? CFPB is suppose to "" police '' these lenders, but it seems as the lenders are policing their selves. This just not fair. All I really want is someone to really help us. We felt we had to reach out to save our home when we did n't get a loan modification form Wells Fargo, which put a {$35000.00} lien on the property. We would have never done that if when we first applied for the modification, Wells Fargo presented us with a reasonable modification. Just another example of Wells Fargo 's lack of communication with letting us know we were modified. Then we felt we had to hire an Attorney to help modify our loan, which put us out {$3000.00}.

This teller appropriately asked for my mother in law ( as it was her account ), to which I advised she was near by, but was sitting as she is XXXX. The teller again reiterated that I would be unable to get the change unless I personally held an account with Wells Fargo. I then asked the teller if I was account holder with the bank would I be able to use the same {$20.00} bill I was presenting to obtain change? The teller advised me that she could, without issue. I then asked if my money held any value to them, being that I am not a current member of the bank. The teller clearly advised me that it does not. I then asked for her business card, as I was not happy with her explanation of the value of my money. I was receiving treatment as a XXXX class citizen, who 's money holds no value outside of the Wells Fargo. A XXXX teller quickly intervened, and advised me the same - that my money does not hold any value in his/the banks eyes, unless I personally have an account with Well Fargo.

He would just say "" a day or so ago '' and then later said he was stuck in a snowstorm in Colorado. In the past I was told when the payment was sent on the exact date and had good communication. So I started getting suspicious. I contacted the XXXX 's client that I was doing the writing for, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, just to let them know that I had not received payment from him and had not received any new work orders from him in order to give them a heads up. They originally requested XXXX to have me write XXXX articles in one month and at the rate we were going, that was not going to be possible. A few days later, XXXX contacted me by email, saying that I badmouthed him to his client and offered to steal his work ( do the work for his client without him being the middle man ). I still had not received payment at that time. That email was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. During that email conversation, I let XXXX know that I did not want to work for him any longer. On XXXX XXXX I received a check in the mail for the amount that I was owed for the work due. I assumed that he was going to go ahead and make good on his payment since I did the work for him.

When I contacted FTB again, they said it was my responsibility to pay because I signed the check and I did not call XXXX 's bank beforehand to ensure that the funds were available. The problem is that the funds would have been available at that time, he cancelled the check later on.

During the process I was asked to agree to a fee which they explained would take the place of my existing interest charges on the account, however when they were unable to negotiate with Capital One and I realized they were not actually my credit card service I requested to cancel my transaction. The man on the phone became very hostile and threatened me with collections on the amount k had agreed to pay before. I asked to speak to a manager and demanded that everything be cancelled because I was no longer interested. I was then told that the previous man I had been speaking too would process my request to cancel and during this process he asked questions that I was uncomfortable answering and when I asked why he needed it he said it was so he could complete the cancelation request. I was then told that I was denied a cancellation but had been approved for a card through XXXX at 0 % interest. I became enraged and told them I did not want a XXXX XXXX and had not been told earlier in the interaction that they would be applying me for another credit card. I was told again that I had no choice and could not cancel the transaction. They then called XXXX and instructed me to tell them I wanted a balance transfer. At this point, believing I had no choice and would be charged anyways I did what they asked and ended the transaction. I did not provide them with my bank routing number as they requested and they said they would call back. Immediately upon ending the phone call I contacted XXXX and told them what happened and they transferred me to the Fraud department who assisted me in cancelling the card and balance transfer. Over the next few days I was called consistantly by a blocked number but did not answer the calls. I then received a message on XXXX that on Friday my bank account would be charged approx {$800.00} for their services and was given a phone number to call the manager back. I called back and spoke to the manager who told me that I had no choice but to pay even though I had cancelled the cards and received no benefit. When I told him that I had tried cancelling at the time because I had not been told previously about having to get a XXXX XXXX and did n't want to continue if that was the process. He basically told me it was n't their fault I did n't understand the process and I had no choice because I had made a verbal contract. He said then that my mandatory payment would be sent to a collection agency and would negatively impact my credit score. I have placed fraud alerts on my accounts but do not want to be negatively affected. I believe I was misled into agreeing to pay for a service when they did not dislose the entire process to me initially. I had even been told verbatum that my credit card number would not chance which I why I did not expect a different credit card account to be created.

In the first instance for the payment due XX/XX/XXXX, First Bankcard credited my account for the late fee and interest when I provided evidence that the payment was deducted from my on-line checking account on the due date, but not posted to their system until the following business day but they have not credited the interest charged the following month ( statement dated XX/XX/XXXX ) of {$38.00}.

66443,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"I went to school at XXXX XXXX XXXX. At the young age of XXXX I really did not know what taking out a loan would mean for me nor had I ever dealt with any kind of debt before. There was no education given to me about what the consequences would be taking out a loan this large and I had no idea what would await for me once I graduated. I did not think much of it and the entire time I was attending college I thought I would just be using my degree I paid all this money for to get a good job that paid well and easily pay back the loans in time. After graduation I soon realized that this mentality was completely incorrect. This is when I began receiving bills from NJCLASS for close to $ XXXX/month on top of the federal loan I had to pay back which about another $ XXXX/month. This was very unsettling and there was no way for me to pay this kind of money straight out of college. It was not easy to find a job after graduating and it probably took me about 1-1.5 years to even find a salary position. During this time I had tried deferring the payments until I had more income and after I could no longer defer it I was just sending as much in my payments as I could given what I was making. How is a young adult supposed to survive on their own under these conditions? I was having difficulty just paying the loans back, forget about me having enough money to buy a car, rent/buy a place to live, start a family, etc. Then just as I was about to have enough money to make these outrageous monthly payments in full I come home to find out that my XXXX loans had defaulted and were sent to a collection agency without much warning at all. It would have been nice if they warned me that my loans were about to be sent to a lawyer 's office that would be tacking on even more money and making my payments even higher allowing for no form of consolidation or rehabilitation. This is when things really got ugly and worry and stress completely consumed my life. I had no idea what dealing with a collection agency meant for me as they mentioned that they could sue me. I started to panic and wound up seeking out a lawyer to talk to about what my options were.I found out that there was no way to rehabilitate. I do not see why the loan could not have been rehabilitated after making consecutive on time full monthly payments. The collection agency had also tacked on about an additional $ XXXX in legal fees to the total amount I owed for my XXXX loans which just seems criminal. They also said I would need to pay them $ XXXX/month now. I could n't believe what was happening to me, if I was already having trouble paying how would making me pay all this extra money help? My lawyer I was seeing told me I either had to agree to pay them the $ XXXX/month or if I could not come up with that I would have to file bankruptcy. I spent awhile mulling over if bankruptcy was the right choice for me because I was unsure how I would come up with that much money. I became so stressed out over this as I could not believe a XXXX year old had to consider bankruptcy because he chose to go to college. I kept just thinking how did my life come to this? I eventually decided I would not file bankruptcy because I did not know how that would affect the rest of my life going forward and I chose to live with my parents and basically have my entire paycheck go to this payment. This made things really hard for me because I did not have money for anything else and the stress and anxiety continued to pile up. I tried many times to work with the collection agency to see if they could lower the payments or work out an alternative payment plan but they would not budge. I am now XXXX and I am still forced to live with my parents and unable to move forward with my life. How can no rehabilitation program be offered?

I am seeking the CFPB 's assistance in directing Wells Fargo to remove the Negative Account entry from my credit report.   The cause of the late payment was simply an oversight & mistake on my part given the amount of travel I was doing for work during the month of XXXX coupled with travel related to the XXXX holiday. The missed payment was not due to any liquidity issues or a troubled situation. Upon realizing the mistake, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo customer service, brought the account current and setup the account on auto-debit going forward.

As a product of this single late payment, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage elected to report this to the consumer credit reporting bureaus which resulted in a negative account being placed on my credit report. The impact to my credit score ( FICO ) due to the negative account that was placed on my credit report has been quite severe. Prior to Wells Fargo reporting the single late payment in XXXX XXXX, my XXXX score was at or over XXXX. Following the negative report entry by Wells Fargo, my score has dropped to XXXX. This revised credit score driven by XXXX mistake made over a 10 year relationship with Wells Fargo I fear is going to severely impact my ability to procure future financing.

He quoted me an offer fora Term and Rate Modification Program at an interest rate of 3 % for 15 months. Monthly payments would be {$280.00}. I told the representative I just did not know how we could cut {$280.00} from our expenses.  He said he only spent {$100.00} per week on food and we could probably cut our food expenses. He also suggested that we cut our cell phone expense of {$170.00}. I explained to him this expense included XXXX cell phones and one home phone.  I certainly do n't think someone living in XXXX has any knowledge of the cost of living expenses in the United States. I felt this comment was totally inappropriate and I was very offended.  I told him we would get back in touch with Navient on XXXX XXXX, when my wife was here.   Navient called us on our home phone and cell phone XXXX times a day. Sometimes, the message would say this is XXXX call me at XXXX, would not say what this pertained to.  On Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 we called Navient, ask to speak to a supervisor, a supposedly domestic agent.

Finally I got a supervisor, a supposedly domestic agent name XXXX XXXX. He ask why we wanted want to speak to a supervisor. That the representative could tell us the same.  REASON we did not want to speak to a representative was they gave us conflicting information about the loan.  The domestic agent, supervisor offered us this program for XXXX months at {$280.00} as opposed to {$280.00}. The supervisor said, we would be charged an interest rate of around 13 % for the first XXXX months then the interest rate would be 3 % for the remaining XXXX months. This contradicts what the representative told us.  They would not allow us to pay on line said we had to make automatic credit card deductions monthly.

Our names are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and we live at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida, XXXX. We have repeatedly been turned down by Wells Fargo for a Home Modification. Although they have let us apply on numerous occasions they have turned us down each time. We feel over the last several years they have been less than honest and have not acted in good faith. They have turned us down for not making enough money, making too much money and recently have turned us down because they say our house is worth {$300000.00} and we owe considerably less. Our house has {$200000.00} plus sinkhole damage which for the last 6 years we have not been able to have it repaired. Our insurance company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was put in receivership by the state of Florida over 5 years ago and to this day is not out of business. We can not petition ( FIGA ) Federal Insurance Guarantee Association to review our case until XXXX is completely out of business. Therefore, we owe much more than the house is worth, we 've never been able to sell the house for what we owe and Wells Fargo completely will not consider our homes true value. They have repeatedly sent us letters and desktop appraisals stating a very inaccurate value. We have spoken to the appraisers and they knew nothing about a sinkhole or any damage, they have never been to the house or property. We have undoubtedly been treated unfair by Wells Fargo and they have knowingly dismissed the sinkhole damage and true house value. We have been advised by our attorney that when Wells Fargo agreed to review our modification that they had a duty to review all factual and proven documents to come to a conclusion, that they have not done. We have spent the day today ( Sunday, XXXX XXXX ) writing letters to our district congressman XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and we are requesting a congressional inquiry investigating Wells Fargo 's practices. We have also requested our attorney on our behalf to file a Federal Lawsuit against Wells Fargo for not acting in good faith. My wife and I are good hard working people involved very heavily in our community. Between the insurance company and Wells Fargo we have lost our investment, our credit and some of our faith in the way our country works. All we have ever asked for is a reasonable and affordable resolution to keep us and our family in our home and not lose the tens of thousands of dollars we have invested in it. The letters will be emailed tonight, we are also writing another letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX CEO of Wells Fargo. We have a new sale date on our home of XXXX XXXX, 2015. We truly feel Wells Fargo is acting in bad faith, we feel like we can prove it. We are waiting until the end of this week for a response from Wells Fargo and if once again they continue to treat us unfairly, we are going to the press. We also have documents from when this all started with Wachovia Bank, they would not review a modification without falling 90 days past due, they would not let us get caught back up after we were behind saying the house was already in foreclosure and also talked us into a "" pick a payment '' loan which now we know is horrible and possibly illegal.

The property was my primary residence for XXXX years but then became a rental due to market conditions when I had to relocate out of state. I did n't realize at the time that making it a rental would disqualify me from assistance programs - I was simply trying to make the payments. The property was listed for short sale and my short sale request was submitted to WF XX/XX/XXXX including an appropriate cash offer from a potential buyer. Months of documentation requests followed. XX/XX/XXXX I finally was told the short sale request was denied by HUD ( FHA loan ) due to monthly cash flow surplus. I disagreed with WF 's calculation and I was concerned they were including rental income when I no longer had tenants. After having difficulty getting in touch with anyone at WF ( I tried numerous numbers ) I went to HUD and they were able to escalate my case to a WF "" supervisor ''. The supervisor researched whether or not rental income was included in the calculation. This took at couple of weeks. The supervisor contacted me and told me that rental income had been excluded. I informed him that I still thought the calculation was incorrect and asked him to walk me through the numbers used. When I heard the number being used for my monthly income I immediately disagreed. The supervisor put me on hold and looked into the number. He came back and told me that the income number was miscalculated and should be about {$500.00} less per month. I requested that he refile a variance with HUD since the previously filed variance was incorrect and overestimated my monthly cash flow substantially. He denied my request stating that HUD denied the variance because of surplus. I argued that had the variance contained the correct surplus, which again was substantially less, my chances of having the variance approved would be greater ( as a variance is a request for an exception ). He refused. Conversation ended and I contacted HUD to request their review ( still pending ). A week or so later I receive a letter from the WF supervisor that he is looking into my inquiry and needs a week. After that week passed he called and said he needed two additional weeks. This now puts me to XX/XX/XXXX. The supervisor called on the last day of the XXXX weeks and essentially repeated our previous conversation. He had only researched AGAIN that rental income had been excluded. I do n't understand why it took nearly a month to look at the same question. I informed the supervisor that we agreed on the rental income part but that per our previous discussion the income amount was miscalculated. The call had been recorded. I repeated my request for a new variance. He said no unless there is a change in circumstance. I said the change is that the calculation was wrong. He still refused. I feel like they are not even truly researching my case and I 'm frustrated that this supervisor is supposedly the highest level of review. They submitted what he admitted to being an incorrect variance and then refused to resubmit a correct request. In addition to all of this, and during the middle of the supervisor 's review, I was served foreclosure papers. It was my understanding that banks could not proceed with foreclosure if my case was still being actively worked as that would be considered dual-tracking.  I have been extremely responsive throughout the process and I 've done everything in my ability to bring this to a close as a short sale. I am still awaiting HUD 's review results but I believe I ca n't get anymore help from WF. Their calculation of my monthly cash flow is incorrect ( the supervisor agreed income was miscalculated ), my request for a CORRECT variance to be filed has been denied and this process has taken months too long.

TENANCY IN COMMONExcept for married couples or registered domestic partners -- who are presumed to acquire all property as community property -- persons who acquire real property jointly normally own the property as tenants in common, unless the instrument under which the property is transferred to them provides otherwise. All co-tenancies between unmarried persons that are not expressly made joint tenancies or partnerships are tenancies in common. A few of the key features of a tenancy in common are : Ownership and Transfer. Unlike joint tenants, tenants in common can own equal or unequal interests in the real property they acquire, and may acquire their interests from different sources at different times.

Please help and make people aware that wells fargo prefers foreclosures over short-sales. They do not offer any help until you are 3 payments behind because it is so HARD to get back from a situation like this. They know what they are doing and what they are doing is wrong!

I have this problem, that could have been yours or Mr. Obama 's.  Let me explain : Scenario 1.  If # potus went to a store and bought apples for {$20.00} using cash. The very next minute he saw his spouse carrying apples that she just bought. He would go back to the cashier and return the apples and get the XXXX dollar bill.  You 're with me - Right. Good now let 's seeScenario 2.  If you go to a store and buy apples for {$20.00} using credit card. The very next minute you see your spouse carrying apples that he/she just bought. You go to the cashier and return the apples and get refund back on the card ( typically a receipt showing it was credited back to your credit card-right ), well then you throw that receipt and forget about it.  You 're still with me - correct.  FACT ~ if you log into your credit card account, you 'll see that you were charged {$20.00} ; but you 'll not see the refund amount for days and weeks & if it never got posted, you threw the receipt, do n't remember the amount, its date etc. its money gone into thin air. Someone pocketed it, you 'll never know or recall & you 'll end up paying the credit card company ( regardless of the actual situation ) till such time you do not get the credit from the vendor.   I had this situation with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2015. They said they had refunded the wrongly charged amount of {$520.00} right away, but it is still not showing on Discover.com even as I write this article on XXXX/XXXX/2015 ( today being the XXXX day ).  Here is a screen shot.    I called Discover and they said it may take around 15 days and if you still do not get the credit then let us know.  If you swipe you credit card at a store and simultaneously log into your credit card account on your smartphone or any smart device like XXXX, you 'll see that the CHARGED amount shows up in less than a minute, but the REFUND TAKES DAYS OR WEEKS.  Something is fishy right here.  What if you walk out of a store with a piece of paper showing the refund amount and then you lose that refund receipt & you did not get the credit back in your account? Money gone!! Bye Bye ... ...  I have a return receipt of {$9.00} dated XXXX/XXXX/2015 from XXXX store XXXX. XXXX, printed at XXXX hours, by associate XXXX. XXXX, transaction number XXXX. I do n't see the refund amount on the credit card company website, whereas my understanding is that I was issued the refund right away as I returned the merchandise.  Now - If I lose the refund receipt, I would not know the exact amount of the refund? How will I ever be able to claim a refund from an invoice that had XXXX items and XXXX item got refunded.  Who is holding my money for 15 days and why?  If the charge was posted on the last day of the billing cycle - I will have to pay the credit card company for merchandise that was returned and refund issued & if I do n't pay the entire amount to the credit card company, then I have to bear interest on short payment.  Scenario 3. Ideally - If I swipe my credit card for {$20.00} & XXXX dollars shows up online as a debit or as a charge ( almost within a few seconds ) then return refund amount SHOULD SHOW UP dynamically too.  The credit card company benefits and I can prove it. Consumers are being milked. I have to pay the money even when I did not buy the merchandise, was issued a refund.

In XXXX, my husband and I got divorced ; and to top it off, I even lost my beloved dog in XXXX as well. The combination of all these events is what caused me to fall behind on my mortgage.

This continued for 3 years (!!! ) until they told me my arrears were now too high and I did n't qualify for assistance. It appears to me that this was their plan all along ... they had no interest in helping me, they just wanted to take my home away via foreclosure.

Our IRA was never serviced by Wells Fargo Investments and our Private Banker told us to move our IRA back to XXXX XXXX where it died a quick death. Our mortgage became underwater and matured after XXXX years and went up and never went down even when the real estate market dropped. We were denied a refinance prior to the XXXX years and we were told we initially we could refinance anytime. Finally with our investments gone and finances not covering our obligations and helping our XXXX children save their homes we decided to file for bankruptcy. In the mean time Wells Fargo Bank without notice reduced our equity line to {$150000.00} without prior notice, our {$25000.00} credit card was reduced to {$12000.00} then to {$4000.00} and made to look like we exceeded our card limit.

The latest was we received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank telling us they overcharged us {$4400.00} during the period of the life of our equity and were putting the amount against the written off amount of the equity line that was closed over a year. We owed {$320000.00} on our mortgage and they sold it for {$350000.00}. We had over {$250000.00} in upgrades in our house. Wells Fargo took our money and never helped us.
